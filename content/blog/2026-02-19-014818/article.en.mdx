Secondly, **the era of Embodied AI is truly upon us**. Unitree Robotics' performance at the Spring Festival Gala, along with the prevailing industry view that AI is moving from the digital to the physical world, underscores this point. AI is no longer just virtual computation; it's acquiring a 'body' and executing tasks in the real world. This will profoundly change manufacturing, services, and even our daily lives. However, this also means that the **urgency of AI ethics and safety issues has reached an unprecedented level**. When robots can truly act autonomously, how do we ensure their behavior aligns with human values? This is a very complex issue requiring global deliberation.

Furthermore, **AI's 'application depth' and 'scenario breadth' are growing exponentially**. From rare disease diagnosis to resolving communication service disruptions, from AI music creation to influencing macroeconomic policies, the scope of AI applications far exceeds what we imagined just a few years ago. Businesses viewing AI as infrastructure indicates that AI has transitioned from being an 'optional tool' to an 'indispensable core competency'.

Behind all this, I see that global society's perception of AI is shifting from a 'tech boom' to 'infrastructure development.' Like electricity and the internet, AI is becoming a cornerstone of modern societal operation. And this infrastructure race is not just a technological contest; it's a comprehensive game involving capital, talent, policy, and ethical standards. Whoever can better balance innovation with risk will gain the upper hand in this grand transformation.

### One-Liner Summary

AI now doesn't just 'know a lot'; it's starting to 'do a lot,' but it's also learned to 'stir up trouble' and 'create ethical dilemmas.' So, we need to learn to get along with this 'smart but still growing' partner!
