### What Happened?

I often tell my friends that the AI world is like a high-speed F1 race, with new technological engines starting up every day, and old concepts spinning out on the bends. Today's AI news (February 22, 2026) particularly resonated with me, making me feel that the AI industry is undergoing a significant period of transformation, a true 'survival of the fittest.' On one hand, startups face survival challenges, while large corporations are constantly deepening their technology and applications; on the other hand, a new global consensus on AI governance and safety has been reached. All of this signals that AI is no longer just "experimental tech" confined to laboratories; it's stepping boldly into our lives, bringing with it more complex ethical and practical challenges.

### Simply Put, What Is This?

Imagine AI as a super-smart "brain." Some startups are merely putting a "pretty skin" over this brain or acting as a "middleman"—these are what Google executives warn are "LLM Wrappers" (Large Language Model wrappers) and "AI Aggregators." They lack their own unique thinking or capabilities, simply packaging someone else's brain functions for you. Google Cloud Global Head of Startups, **Darren Mowry**, explicitly stated that this model, relying on "thin layers of intellectual property," is as dangerous as a car with an "engine warning light" in today's mature AI market. Because as the underlying brains get smarter, the value of these "skins" and "middlemen" diminishes, and they will quickly be phased out by the market.

### According to Reports, Details Are as Follows

First, let's look at the critical warning from Google executive **Darren Mowry**. He pointed out that the era when merely adding a user interface to a large language model (LLM) could attract attention, which was true around mid-2024, is now over. The market has lost patience with companies that rely excessively on backend models without adding substantial unique value. He further advised startups to avoid "aggregator" businesses, as users require integrated intellectual property that intelligently routes requests based on needs, rather than just backend computing or access restrictions. For instance, code assistant service **Cursor** and legal assistant **Harvey AI** are cited as successful examples due to their "deep moats."

<Callout type="info" title="Key Point: LLM Wrappers and AI Aggregators">
LLM Wrappers typically build a product or user experience interface on top of existing large language models such as OpenAI GPT, Google Gemini, or Anthropic Claude to solve specific problems. AI Aggregators integrate multiple large language models into a single interface or API, providing multi-model access. Both face significant challenges due to a lack of core technological differentiation.

However, this doesn't mean AI development has stalled. Quite the opposite: **Google DeepMind** announced the greatly enhanced **Gemini 3.1 Pro** model on February 19, 2026 (news reported on February 21-22)! This model is designed to handle complex multi-step tasks, long-range agent workflows, and native multi-modal code generation. It introduces a three-tiered thinking system, allowing developers to adjust computation time based on task complexity, balancing output latency and inference depth.

In terms of performance, Gemini 3.1 Pro achieved a score of **77.1%** on the ARC-AGI-2 abstract reasoning benchmark, nearly double that of its predecessor Gemini 3 Pro, and surpassing competitors like GPT-5.2 at **52.9%** and Opus 4.6 at **68.8%**. Its output capacity has also significantly expanded to **65,536 tokens**, resolving the previous version's truncated code generation limitations and enabling developers to fully reconstruct large code documents.

Beyond Google, other tech giants are also accelerating their deployment in AI hardware applications. **Meta** is reportedly planning to integrate facial recognition functionality, codenamed "Name Tag," into its **Ray-Ban smart glasses**, allowing wearers to identify people around them and retrieve information. This feature has raised widespread privacy concerns. Concurrently, Meta is expected to launch a smartwatch integrating AI and health tracking in 2026, aiming to compete with the Apple Watch in the wearables market.

Even **OpenAI** is rumored to launch its first AI speaker with a camera as early as 2027, with plans to venture into smart glasses, smart desk lamps, and other hardware products. Former Apple Chief Design Officer **Jony Ive** is even personally overseeing the hardware design, indicating OpenAI's determination to enter the physical AI domain. However, OpenAI has also significantly adjusted its infrastructure investment targets, reducing 2030 spending from an initial **$1.4 trillion** to **$60 billion**, reflecting a cautious approach to capital allocation and revenue generation capabilities.

In the realm of AI Agents, practical applications are becoming evident. **Samsung Galaxy AI** is continuously expanding its multi-agent ecosystem, with research showing nearly **80%** of users currently relying on more than two AI Agents for daily tasks. Galaxy AI acts as a "conductor" for these agents, providing a more natural interactive experience. Furthermore, Okta has launched its "Agent Discovery" feature, designed to help enterprises discover and manage "shadow AI" agents, enhancing corporate identity security posture management.

AI's driving force on the hardware industry is even more significant. Taiwan's two major research institutions, ITRI and MIC, jointly released their 2026 technology industry trends report, indicating that generative AI is strongly driving the growth of semiconductor and AI server shipments. Global AI server shipments are projected to reach **4.5 million units** by 2026, with a market penetration rate of **30%**. Taiwan's semiconductor industry output is expected to exceed **NT$7 trillion** in 2026, a **10%** year-on-year increase. IC manufacturing, in particular, is projected to grow by **12%** year-on-year due to full 3nm capacity and 2nm production contributions, solidifying Taiwan's critical position in the global high-performance computing supply chain. Edge AI hardware penetration is also expected to approach **20%**, with AI glasses shipments reaching **9.5 million units**.

Regarding AI governance and ethics, a global consensus is forming. India's **AI Impact Summit**, held from February 18-19, 2026, concluded successfully, with the **"New Delhi AI Impact Declaration"** released on February 21, receiving endorsement from **88 countries** and international organizations worldwide. This declaration calls for the development of "safe, trustworthy, and robust" artificial intelligence, emphasizing that AI's benefits should be shared equitably by all humanity. The declaration is structured around seven major pillars (or "chakras"), covering human capital development, social empowerment, trustworthiness of AI systems, energy efficiency, AI science applications, democratization of AI resources, and economic growth and social benefits. Notably, the US delegation initially expressed reservations about global AI governance, emphasizing innovation freedom, but ultimately signed the declaration. The summit also pledged **$250 billion** in infrastructure investment and **$20 billion** in deep tech research funding.

Energy consumption was also a concern, with the summit acknowledging AI's growing demand for power resources and calling for more efficient AI systems. OpenAI CEO **Sam Altman** also took the opportunity to refute "false claims" about ChatGPT's water consumption, emphasizing that data centers no longer use water-intensive evaporative cooling technologies.

However, the rapid development of AI also brings cybersecurity risks from "Shadow AI," akin to the "shadow IT" problem I often discussed previously, where employees use public AI tools without authorization, potentially leading to confidential data leaks or system vulnerabilities. In the logistics industry, **22%** of business leaders admit employees have used unauthorized AI tools to handle shipping documents. In healthcare, nearly **17%** of medical professionals admit to using unauthorized AI tools. This situation highlights the urgent need for enterprises to strengthen AI talent governance and cybersecurity risk prevention.

### What Does This Mean for Us?

I think the most direct impact is that if you're an AI startup founder, you can no longer simply survive by "packaging" foundational models. The market will become increasingly discerning, and you'll need genuine "unique skills" to survive. It's like opening a restaurant: if you just reheat frozen food, you'll quickly be beaten by restaurants with their own signature dishes.

For general users, smarter and more capable AI models like Google Gemini 3.1 Pro mean we can solve more complex problems with AI, potentially significantly boosting our work efficiency. Imagine AI no longer just writing articles; it can plan a multi-week project for you or even directly generate runnable code! This will make our digital lives more convenient, but it might also increase our reliance on AI.

Meta and OpenAI's aggressive investment in AI hardware signals that AI will move from screens into our daily surroundings. Smart glasses and AI speakers could completely change how we interact with the digital world. However, this also brings serious privacy concerns, especially with features like Meta's smart glasses' facial recognition, which could "see" you clearly without your knowledge. This is a personal concern of mine.

As for the global consensus on AI governance, although non-binding, it at least gets governments talking about how to make AI "good." This is crucial for protecting our rights and preventing AI from spiraling into a "dark side." The "shadow AI" problem, on the other hand, reminds us that while enjoying AI's convenience, we must always be vigilant about cybersecurity risks, lest personal or corporate sensitive data be unknowingly "consumed" and used for training by AI models.

### Insider's Deep Analysis

Behind this, I see the inevitable trend of the AI industry shifting from "concept hype" to "pragmatism." Initially, everyone chased the LLM craze, leading to a proliferation of "thin-layered" startups. But as foundational models grow stronger and more widespread, companies lacking core competitiveness will naturally be marginalized. This reaffirms the ironclad rule in technology: only by continuously innovating and deepening one's technological moat can one survive long-term.

Large tech companies, meanwhile, are going full throttle on "soft-hard integration." Google continues to solidify its leadership in model technology with Gemini 3.1 Pro, while Meta and OpenAI extend the battlefield to physical hardware. This is a crucial shift, signifying that AI is no longer just computing in the virtual world; it will truly become "embodied AI," entering our physical space. This is not merely a product update but a deep restructuring of the industry.

The New Delhi Declaration from the global AI summit is a significant milestone. Although non-binding, it represents a deepening international consensus that AI development should balance "innovation" with "safety, reliability, and trustworthiness." This is vital for promoting responsible AI innovation. The emergence of "shadow AI" problems further reminds us that AI governance isn't just about macro-level national policies; it must also permeate enterprise and individual daily usage habits. Businesses need not only technical defenses but also cultural and managerial transformations to truly navigate this AI wave.

Taiwan's position in the global AI supply chain is once again highlighted. From the ITRI and MIC reports, our semiconductor and ICT industries play an indispensable role in the AI era, especially in high-performance computing. This also gives us an insight: in the AI competition, countries that master core technologies and critical components are truly able to wield influence and economic advantage.

### One-Liner Summary

The AI world is an elimination round: trend-followers will be swiftly ousted, while true winners are those who deeply cultivate technology, embrace hardware, and remain anchored by ethics.
