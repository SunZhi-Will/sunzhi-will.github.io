### What Happened?

Friends, there are a few juicy "tech tidbits" today worth chatting about! First off, global semiconductor giants have been absolutely on fire lately, with profits skyrocketing through the roof. The big hero behind all this? The "AI chips" everyone's clamoring for! Nvidia and TSMC, these two behemoths, are practically swimming in cash, directly smashing historical records. This tells us that AI truly isn't kidding around; it's a bona fide "money printer"!

But the big question is, will the money printed by this "machine" really make it into every AI company's pocket? The discussion around an "AI bubble" is also heating up. Some think current investments are too wild and will eventually burst; others argue this is laying the groundwork for the future, just like the dot-com boom. In short, everyone's asking: "Can AI actually make money?"

However, aside from this "million-dollar question" of profitability, AI itself is evolving! While we used to think of AI as a super-brain behind a screen, it's now actively trying to "grow a body," transforming into robots that can move and operate. This is what we call "embodied intelligence"—sounds pretty cool, right? Imagine a future where robots don't just answer your questions but can also bring you coffee, tighten screws, or even care for the sick. That's straight out of a sci-fi movie!

### Simply Put, What Is This? (Metaphor Time)

Let me use a few brilliant metaphors to explain these seemingly "hardcore" tech terms.

**1. AI and Semiconductor Profit Frenzy: Chips are the "Shovels" of the Gold Rush**
Imagine a massive "AI gold rush" sweeping across the globe right now. Everyone's scrambling to dig for treasure, and these semiconductor giants, like Nvidia and TSMC, aren't selling gold mines; they're selling the most essential "shovels" for digging gold—AI chips. When everyone floods into the gold fields, who makes money first? Of course, it's the folks selling the shovels! So, as everyone wildly chases AI applications, these companies providing the foundational hardware are naturally the first to rake in massive profits. Their record-breaking profits are proof of just how real and robust this AI boom is.

**2. The AI Bubble Debate: It's Like a Grand "Tech Wager"**
So, what's the "AI bubble" about? It's like a high-stakes gamble, with the table laden with various AI startups and their "dream blueprints." The house (investors) keeps pouring in money, hoping these dreams will turn into cold, hard cash. Optimists believe that even if some companies aren't profitable yet, they're building the "new world infrastructure" for the future and will eventually shine brightly. Pessimists, however, think many companies are overvalued and can't deliver on their promises in the short term, and this money will eventually go "pop!" like an inflated bubble. The outcome of this wager is still anyone's guess; everyone is holding their breath.

**3. Embodied AI: AI Is No Longer Just a "Smart Brain"; It's an "Intern" with a "Body"**
The AI we used before, like Google Search when you ask a question or ChatGPT when writing an article, were all like "super-smart brains" but without hands or feet, operating only in the virtual world. Embodied AI, on the other hand, is like this smart brain finally getting its own body, able to step out of the computer screen and run, jump, touch, and interact in the real world.

Imagine you hired a very clever intern (an AI brain) who knows a lot, but if you ask them to make coffee, they can only tell you the steps. Now, this intern has "embodied intelligence." They not only know the steps but can also walk to the coffee machine, grab a cup, pour water, add coffee grounds, and finally deliver a steaming hot coffee right to your hand. That's the magic of embodied intelligence: it evolves AI from "just talking" to "doing," transforming it from passively answering questions into a "digital colleague" or "life assistant" capable of actively executing tasks.

### According to Reports, Details Are as Follows

According to Nikkei Asia, the robust demand for AI propelled 11 major global semiconductor manufacturers to an unprecedented combined net profit of **$80.1 billion** in the most recent quarter (approximately July to September 2025), a staggering 130% increase compared to the same period last year! Among these, AI chip leader **Nvidia** alone contributed approximately **40%**, or **$31.9 billion**, of the net profit, growing by a full 65%.

Taiwan's **TSMC**, which manufactures chips for Nvidia, also performed remarkably, with net profits soaring by 50% to **$15.1 billion**, marking two consecutive quarters of record highs and contributing about **20%** of the overall profit. Other companies like South Korea's SK Hynix and Micron, which produce HBM (High Bandwidth Memory), also saw significant profit increases due to strong AI memory demand, soaring by 110% and 260% respectively. However, slowing electric vehicle sales have posed a challenge for automotive chip manufacturers like STMicroelectronics, which faced declining profits.

Regarding AI applications and market trends, TIME magazine named Meta's **Mark Zuckerberg**, AMD's **Lisa Su**, xAI's **Elon Musk**, OpenAI's **Sam Altman**, DeepMind's **Demis Hassabis**, Anthropic's **Dario Amodei**, Stanford Professor **Fei-Fei Li**, and Nvidia CEO **Jensen Huang** as the "AI Architects" for its 2025 Person of the Year list, emphasizing that 2025 is "the year AI's full potential was unleashed." The report highlighted that AI's versatility has significantly lowered the entry barrier across various industries, transforming it from merely a localized tool into a foundational capability.

Concerning "embodied intelligence," XinhuaNet reported that this technology is bringing AI from the virtual world into physical reality. At the 3rd National AI Application Scenario Innovation Challenge in 2025, several astonishing achievements were showcased: For instance, a "flexible assembly intelligent robot" demonstrated human-like "hand-eye coordination," capable of precisely completing complex industrial manufacturing tasks; an "intelligent amphibious unmanned transport system" can operate autonomously 24/7 in harsh marine environments; and a "new-generation neuro-current feedback rehabilitation robot control system" can accurately sense a patient's brain activity to provide personalized rehabilitation training, addressing the shortage of medical resources. This illustrates how AI large models provide robots with a "brain," while embodied intelligence provides the "cerebellum" and "limbs," enabling them to think and act like humans.

Furthermore, as AI advances, cybersecurity issues cannot be overlooked. NVIDIA, for example, released a security update for its robotics and AI development simulation platform, "NVIDIA Isaac Sim," due to a critical vulnerability (CVE-2025-33210) discovered in its "NVIDIA Isaac Lab" component. Attackers could potentially exploit this vulnerability with specially crafted data to execute remote code. This vulnerability was rated "Critical" with a CVSSv3.1 base score of **9.0**.

### What Does This Mean for Us?

These latest AI developments are closely intertwined with our daily lives and work:

**Impact on Our Wallets:** Semiconductor giants' stock prices continue to "surge, surge, surge," so if you've invested in related industries, you might feel your wallet getting fatter. But at the same time, the AI bubble discussion reminds us that investments carry risks; don't just get caught up in the hype—look closely at the actual value. JPMorgan Chase warned that while generative AI was hot in 2025, the actual revenue and profits it generated were not as expected. Companies are now prioritizing the return on investment (ROI) for AI, rather than blindly following trends.

**Impact on Our Jobs:** The development of AI Agents and embodied intelligence means that in the future, more repetitive tasks, and even some requiring hand-eye coordination, will be replaced by AI and robots. For example, tedious processes that once required human customer service might be handled by an AI Agent in the future. It's like hiring a "super-efficient digital colleague" who can help you process documents, check grammar, or even automatically correct code errors. But don't worry, this also means we humans can spend our time on more creative tasks, those requiring human interaction, and complex judgment.

**Impact on Our Lives:** If embodied intelligent robots truly become widespread, your life will become much more convenient. You might have robots doing chores at home, smart devices assisting with rehabilitation in hospitals, and even unmanned transport systems serving as delivery drivers. All these will make our lives more flexible and allow us to enjoy more personalized services. Furthermore, the deep integration of AI with sensors also opens up new possibilities, such as "electronic nose" technology, which might be applied to food safety or medical diagnostics in the future.

**Impact on Society and Governance:** While AI rapidly develops, it also brings new governance challenges. The Taiwan Independent Directors Association pointed out that AI's biggest challenge isn't the technology itself, but "governance and risk management." For instance, if AI credit assessment models are poorly designed, they could lead to unfair issues like gender discrimination. It's like powerful magic: if rules aren't set properly, it could lead to unexpected troubles. This also means we need more legal and ethical experts who understand AI to help establish rules, ensuring AI serves humanity, not the other way around. Cybersecurity is also paramount; vulnerabilities like NVIDIA's remind us that even the most advanced technology requires stringent oversight to prevent potential crises.

### Insider's Deep Analysis

From the perspective of a senior investigative journalist, today's news items reveal several key messages:

**1. AI Infrastructure Development Enters a "Super Race":** The astonishing profits of semiconductor giants clearly indicate that global demand for AI computing power has reached an unprecedented level. This is not just a technological race, but also a capital race. Companies like Nvidia and TSMC hold the "shovel seller's" advantage, making them hard to shake in the short term. This "AI infrastructure wave" is expected to continue for some time, with Micron even poised to lead a new round of growth in AI memory chips in 2026.

**2. AI Applications Shift Towards "Real-World Implementation is King":** While AI's potential is limitless, the emergence of the "bubble theory" reflects an increasingly strict market scrutiny of actual profitability. In early 2025, CEOs had high expectations for generative AI's revenue and profit, but by year-end, actual results fell short of projections. This will prompt AI companies to shift from their past "big spending" pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) ideals towards a more pragmatic "sixpence" approach (concrete, real-world applications). Those who can first translate AI technology into tangible business value will survive this reshuffle. This also explains why research like Agentic Context Engineering (ACE), which allows smaller models to approach GPT-4 performance while reducing costs and latency, is gaining so much attention, as it makes "practicalization" more feasible.

**3. "Embodied Intelligence" Inaugurates AI's "Physical Era":** The development of embodied intelligence signifies that AI is no longer content with merely dominating the "digital world," but is actively pushing further into the "physical world." This is not only a massive technological leap but also a profound transformation in business models and social interaction. When robots possess the closed-loop capabilities of "perception, cognition, decision-making, and action," they will no longer be mere tools but true "collaborators." This "third wave of AI" will reshape industries such as manufacturing, healthcare, and logistics, creating new industries and opportunities currently beyond our imagination.

**4. Governance and Cybersecurity Emerge as AI's "Achilles' Heel":** As technology rapidly advances, AI governance, ethics, and cybersecurity issues are becoming increasingly prominent. The discrimination controversy sparked by Apple Card's AI model, as well as the critical vulnerability discovered in NVIDIA's simulation platform, have both sounded alarm bells. This reminds us that without robust regulations, clear ethical guidelines, and watertight cybersecurity defenses, AI development is like a sports car without brakes—no matter how fast it goes, it could crash and burn. Intellectual property protection also plays a crucial role in this, ensuring innovation while balancing fairness and security.

In summary, the AI world at the end of 2025 is like a boiling pot of soup: new ingredients are constantly being added (embodied intelligence), old flavors are being re-adjusted (profit orientation), and one must also be careful not to get scalded by the overflowing broth (cybersecurity and governance).

### One-Liner Summary

AI's journey so far sees the money-makers making big bucks, the dreamers still figuring out how to cash in their visions, and robots secretly learning how to brew their own coffee. But let's not forget, while enjoying the intelligence dividend, we must buckle up with cybersecurity and erect ethical guardrails, or "super intelligence" might just turn into "super trouble"!
