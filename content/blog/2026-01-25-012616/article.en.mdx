### What Happened?

Hey everyone, good morning! Today's AI news (January 25, 2026) is simply dizzying. I feel like AI is a sports car with a jet engine – we just said "accelerate," and it's already rocketed into outer space. These past few days, from the lively discussions at the Davos World Economic Forum to the physical robot battles at CES 2026, and the strategic layouts by various governments, all repeatedly show that AI has transformed from a "future trend" into a "present reality." It's not just intelligently thinking in the digital world; now it's "getting its hands dirty" in the real world, ready to change our lives.

However, like any new tool, while AI brings convenience, it also sparks deep reflections on trust, ethics, and societal impact. As AI increasingly resembles our personal "assistants" or even "doctors" in our lives, how should we view its advice? Will its "attentiveness" turn into "over-intimacy"? That's what I most want to discuss with you today.

### Simply Put, What Is This?

Imagine having a "super butler" in your life, one that not only knows your preferences but also handles all sorts of chores for you. For instance, in the past, booking concert tickets might mean glued to your computer, frantically fighting for tickets and filling out tons of personal details; now, this "super butler" might just take care of it for you directly. This is what's happening with AI right now: it's evolving from merely "thinking" to analyze big data, to "acting" and executing tasks. And it's not just limited to professionals; even us "non-techies" can easily command it.

But this butler isn't omnipotent. What if it gives you crucial medical advice, but that advice is wrong, or even detrimental to your health? It would be like your smart fridge suddenly suggesting you drink expired milk as if it were fresh – you'd break out in a cold sweat, right? This is precisely what I mean: AI's role as a "super butler" is now facing a massive "trust test."

### According to Reports, Details Are as Follows

The AI dynamics over the past two days have been incredibly rich, and I've summarized a few core findings:

**1. AI Popularization: Even Non-Engineers Can Get Hands-On** 📊
Anthropic recently announced that their **Claude Code** has, in just six months, transformed from a research preview product into a star commodity valued at **$1 billion**. What surprises me most is that this growth momentum isn't coming from professional software engineers but from "non-programmers" like you and me! These individuals are leveraging Claude Code to handle various daily tasks, from booking theater tickets, filing taxes, and monitoring tomato plants, to automating Slack messages and organizing museum archives. Anthropic also launched **Cowork**, a new product specifically designed for non-developers, allowing them to enjoy the convenience brought by AI and even process local files – an impact much larger than I anticipated. A colleague shared that her personal AI assistant, **MARVIN**, developed based on Claude Code, completed tasks that used to take 4 hours in just 30 minutes, calling it her "new best friend."

**2. Warning! A Trust Crisis in AI Medical Information** 🚨
However, the flip side of AI popularization is potential risk. The Guardian points out that **Google AI Overviews**, in its "confident authority" stance when providing health-related information, is endangering public health. Research shows that Google AI Overviews cites YouTube content as a source for health queries even more frequently than many professional medical websites. More worryingly, some AI-generated medical summaries have been found to offer "completely incorrect" medical advice. For example, it wrongly advised pancreatic cancer patients to avoid high-fat foods, which experts state is precisely the opposite of what should be recommended, potentially increasing patients' risk of death. In another "shocking" case, Google provided erroneous information about liver function tests, which could lead patients with severe liver disease to mistakenly believe they are healthy, delaying crucial medical attention. This truly makes one's heart sink; no matter how smart AI is, we need to examine it with rigorous scrutiny.

<Callout type="info" title="Urgent Need for AI Information Verification">
When AI acts as an information provider, especially in high-risk areas like medical health, the accuracy and credibility of its information are paramount. Public trust issues concerning AI medical diagnoses highlight the importance of establishing strict content review mechanisms and transparent information sources.
</Callout>

**3. CES 2026: The Rise of Physical AI, Robots Take Center Stage** 🤖
The annual International Consumer Electronics Show (CES 2026) has successfully concluded (or is ongoing) in Las Vegas, USA. This year's exhibition theme shifted from emphasizing "model capabilities" to "product capabilities," focusing more on how AI can be massively applied in the real world. I observed that **Edge AI** and **Physical AI** became core directions for technological breakthroughs.

The competition in the humanoid robot exhibition area, in particular, was fierce. **Hyundai Motor Group** showcased their all-electric **Atlas robot**, featuring **360-degree rotating joints**, aiming directly at **Tesla's Optimus** dominance in industrial automation. Chinese manufacturers also showed strong performance; **Unitree Robotics** even opened the world's first robot retail store in Beijing, where consumers can purchase a **G1 robot** for **85,000 RMB**. Among the **38** participating humanoid robot manufacturers, Chinese companies accounted for **21**. This makes me wonder if, in future factories, it won't just be humans working anymore.

**Nvidia** CEO **Jensen Huang**, in his keynote speech, also heavily elaborated on the vision of "Physical AI transforming 10 million factories" and released a new generation of gaming AI GPUs and robot-specific chips. This also fueled competition in the semiconductor industry, with **AMD** and **Intel** also launching new products in response.

**4. National Strategy: From Singapore to Taiwan, Nations Vie for AI Supremacy** 🇸🇬🇹🇼
Governments worldwide also deeply understand the importance of AI and are actively investing resources.

*   **Singapore**: Singapore will invest over **S$1 billion (approximately US$785 million)** over five years, from **2025 to 2030**, to strengthen its public AI research capabilities. This massive investment will focus on foundational AI research, applied AI, and talent development, with the goal of establishing "world-class" AI research centers and encouraging open sharing of research findings to contribute to the global knowledge base.
*   **Taiwan**: Taiwan's Ministry of Digital Affairs' Digital Industry Administration (數產署) also expects to update its AI industry talent identification guidelines in the **second quarter** of this year, adding **AI governance capabilities** and **AI collaborative development capabilities**. I believe this is a very forward-looking initiative, as it not only focuses on technological development but also recognizes the importance of AI ethics and cross-domain collaboration. Furthermore, the Digital Industry Administration will cooperate with the private sector to develop AI general-purpose teaching materials and committed to expanding AI computing power this year, reaching a cumulative total of **140 latest GPUs** to support innovative applications by information service providers. They are even discussing incorporating AI computing centers into major public infrastructure projects, allowing investors to enjoy tax incentives.

**5. Davos Forum: AI's 'Love-Hate Relationship' with Employment** 💼
At the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, AI was a central topic of discussion. While AI will replace some jobs, participating business leaders were generally optimistic, believing AI will also create a large number of new jobs. **Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang** even proclaimed "jobs, jobs, jobs," emphasizing that AI will create more high-paying positions in energy, chip industries, and infrastructure. However, a paradoxical phenomenon was also noted in a report: while AI can boost the productivity of novice employees by **34%**, for experts, it sometimes reduces efficiency and increases review time. This makes me wonder whether AI is here to augment our scores or to redefine our roles in the workplace.

<StatsHighlight
  title="AI's Impact on Workplace Productivity"
  stats={[{value: "34%", label: "Novice employee productivity increase"}, {value: "87%", label: "Business leaders view AI as a top cyber risk"}]}
/>

**6. AI Ethics and Trust: Unavoidable Challenges** ⚖️
From misleading medical information to AI-generated news summaries potentially marginalizing the Australian news industry, the ethical challenges posed by AI are increasingly evident. Transparency, fairness, privacy protection, and accountability have become cornerstones for responsible AI development. As "Future Ventures" puts it: "We are not living in the age of AI; we are living in the age of AI consequences." Ensuring AI systems align with societal values, that decisions are explainable, and data privacy is respected, are shared tasks we must confront while enjoying the conveniences of AI.

### What Does This Mean for Us?

I believe this wave of AI is truly impacting each of us far more profoundly than we might imagine.

Firstly, for us "non-techies," programming used to feel like an engineer's exclusive domain. But now, tools like **Claude Code** allow us to "command" AI using natural language to complete complex tasks. It's like suddenly receiving a superpower key that unlocks many doors previously thought out of reach. Your workflow might be greatly simplified, with repetitive tasks handled by AI, freeing you to focus your energy on more creative and interpersonal areas.

<StepGuide
  title="How to Embrace New AI Skills?"
  steps={[
    {title: "Experiment with AI Tools", description: "Start by automating daily tasks, such as using AI for scheduling or email management."},
    {title: "Learn Prompt Engineering", description: "Master giving AI clear and effective instructions to make it serve you better."},
    {title: "Pay Attention to AI Ethics", description: "Understand the potential risks of AI, cultivate critical thinking, and don't blindly trust AI outputs."}
  ]}
/>

But at the same time, AI's "confidence" can also lead to "disaster." Consider **Google AI Overviews**' errors in medical information; if we blindly trust all information provided by AI, especially at critical health junctures, the consequences could be unimaginable. This tells me that the smarter AI becomes, the more we ourselves need the ability to discern information's authenticity, and not fully cede our judgment to machines.

From a macro perspective, the **Physical AI** trend showcased at **CES 2026** implies that AI is no longer just intelligence on a screen. It will integrate more directly into our physical lives through robots and smart devices. In the future, your home might feature robots that fold laundry or fetch milk, and "silicon-based labor" will become increasingly common in factories. This will make our lives more convenient but also impact the labor market, requiring us to think proactively about transformation and adaptation. You can refer to our previous discussion on this:

### Insider's Deep Analysis

From the perspective of a seasoned investigative journalist, I believe today's news indicates that AI development has entered a critical phase of "practical application and implementation." In recent years, we've witnessed an explosive growth in AI model capabilities, such as the GPT series continuously pushing the boundaries of language understanding and generation. But now, the market and users are more concerned with "What can this thing actually do for me?" and "Will it mess up when I use it?"

The success of **Anthropic's Claude Code** proves that **AI applications are no longer an exclusive playground for tech professionals**. It is "deskillifying" technology, allowing more ordinary users to enjoy the efficiency dividends brought by AI. This is a massive market shift, meaning that in the future, more "AI-powered" tools will emerge across various industries, significantly lowering the barriers to automation and intelligence.

However, **Google AI Overviews' medical blunder** serves as a wake-up call, reminding us of the significant gap between AI's "authoritativeness" and "accuracy," especially in high-risk, highly specialized fields. This is not just a technical issue, but a matter of trust. If AI can mislead on even the most basic information, how can it build public trust in more complex decision-making scenarios, such as medical diagnoses or financial risk assessments? This also explains why **AI ethics, transparency, and explainability** are repeatedly emphasized in Davos and in the strategies of various governments.

<InsightQuote

  author="TechPlain Language Storyteller"
  role="Senior Tech Commentator"
/>

Concurrently, the **Physical AI craze at CES 2026** also foreshadows that the next wave of technological competition will shift from the virtual world to the physical world. From industrial robots to home assistants, AI is imbuing hardware with "intelligence," creating what's known as "silicon-based labor." This will not only reshape manufacturing and service industries but also profoundly impact global supply chains and the semiconductor industry. Taiwan, in this wave, with its advantage in semiconductor manufacturing, particularly **TSMC's** leadership in advanced processes, is poised to continue playing a crucial role in the global AI ecosystem. The government's proactive efforts to cultivate AI talent and computing power precisely recognize this trend.

Overall, AI is transforming from a "smart brain" into "capable hands," and these hands are reaching into every corner of our lives. This transformation is both exciting and challenging.

### One-Liner Summary

AI now not only writes poetry, draws, and codes, but it has also learned to book tickets, check your health, and even move bricks for you; yet, when it speaks incorrectly, it can be more alarming than your child lying. So remember, your critical thinking is always the best "AI firewall"!
