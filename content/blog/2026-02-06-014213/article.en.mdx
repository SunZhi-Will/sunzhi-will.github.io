### What Happened?

Hey there, folks! If you've noticed your tech gadgets getting smarter lately, that's no illusion. Let me tell you, AI isn't just writing articles and drawing pictures anymore; it's even starting to "spend your money" for you! Today, we're diving into a slew of major AI news. On one hand, tech giants are splashing cash on AI infrastructure without batting an eye, while on the other, there's a serious warning that AI learning data might "run out of ammo" in the near future. It makes even this seasoned reporter wonder: Is AI about to soar to new heights, or will it hit an unexpected bottleneck?

### Simply Put, What Is This?

Imagine no longer needing to open shopping websites, compare prices, or click 'buy' yourself. Instead, your AI assistant, like a thoughtful butler, automatically completes the entire shopping process for you after you state your needs. This is the future of "agentic commerce" envisioned by **Visa**.

Behind the digital services we use every day, like **Amazon's** cloud services (AWS) or **Google's** search and cloud computing, their increasing intelligence and responsiveness are thanks to tech giants pouring massive investments into building "super brains" for AI – its infrastructure. You can think of this infrastructure as AI's "gym," constantly needing expansion and updated equipment to keep AI, the "athlete," getting stronger.

But don't think money and equipment solve everything. Just like a top student needs a vast library of textbooks to learn, AI needs "data" to grow. Now, a "2026 Problem" is quietly approaching, predicting that the high-quality data we rely on to train AI might soon run out. It's like that top student suddenly finding the library has no more books – what's next? The answer is creating "synthetic data," letting AI write its own "textbooks," or making models more "lean" and efficient, known as "model miniaturization."

### According to Reports, Details Are as Follows

This AI frenzy isn't just talk. Judging by the latest financial reports and market forecasts, tech giants are pouring money into AI like scattering beans:

*   **Visa's Bold AI Shopping Prediction** 🛒
    Global payment technology giant **Visa** projects that by the **2026 holiday shopping season**, millions of consumers will rely on AI agents to complete purchases, rather than merely assisting them. Currently, nearly **half (47%)** of U.S. shoppers already use AI tools for at least one shopping task, such as price comparison or product recommendations. Visa has been piloting "agentic e-commerce" programs in the Americas and will launch its "Visa Intelligent Commerce" platform in Asia Pacific in early 2026, while also collaborating with regulators to establish industry standards and norms for this new technology.

*   **Amazon's AI Infrastructure Frenzy** ⚡
    E-commerce behemoth **Amazon** expects its capital expenditures to surge over **50%** this year, planning to invest up to **$200 billion** in 2026 to strengthen its AI infrastructure. CEO **Andy Jassy** mentioned in the earnings call that despite the massive AI spending, its cloud platform Amazon Web Services (AWS) still grew revenue by **24%** in Q4 2025, reaching **$35.6 billion**. Furthermore, Amazon announced an investment of up to **$50 billion**, specifically for expanding its AI and supercomputing capabilities for U.S. government agencies, a project set to begin in 2026.

*   **Alphabet's AI Cloud Engine** ☁️
    Google's parent company, **Alphabet**, also showed strong performance. In its Q4 2025 earnings report, overall annual revenue surpassed the **$400 billion** mark for the first time. Google Cloud's performance was particularly impressive, with revenue growing by **48%** to **$17.75 billion**. The company expects capital expenditures in 2026 to reach **$175 billion to $185 billion**, nearly double that of 2025, to meet the immense demand for AI products. CEO **Sundar Pichai** emphasized that AI investments and infrastructure are driving revenue and growth across the board. He also noted the rapid growth of Google's Gemini AI users, reaching **750 million** monthly active users by year-end.

*   **AI Data Depletion Warning: The "2026 Problem"** ⚠️
    However, behind this AI feast lies a massive challenge. The **Epoch AI** research team predicts that high-quality AI training data globally, especially human-written text data, could be exhausted between **2026 and 2028**, possibly even reaching its limit as early as **2026**. Currently, about **300 trillion tokens** of high-quality public text are available, but AI models are becoming increasingly complex, with data demand growing exponentially. This means that without new solutions, the pace of AI's progress could significantly slow down.

      author="AI Twerp"
      role="AI Analyst"
    />

*   **Synthetic Data and Model Miniaturization: New Strategies for Data Scarcity** 💡
    To address this impending "data drought," the industry is shifting towards new research and development directions. One such direction is the generation of "synthetic data," creating large volumes of simulated data using generative AI and mixing it with human-curated data. This "Synthetic Twin Data" can provide virtually limitless training material, be generated on demand to fill specific gaps, and even help eliminate biases inherent in historical human data. The synthetic data market size is expected to reach **$3.5 billion** by 2026, with enterprise adoption growing from **35%** to **68%**.

    Another direction is "model miniaturization" (Small Language Models, SLMs), making AI models lighter and more efficient, allowing them to run directly on "edge devices" such as mobile phones or wearables, providing fast, private, and reliable services. Microsoft's Phi series models have demonstrated that, through carefully curated synthetic data training, small models can achieve the performance of large models, even running on a laptop.

*   **Diverse Enterprise AI Services and OpenAI's New Platform** 🚀
    AI's professional applications in enterprise services are also maturing. **OpenAI** today launched an enterprise-grade platform called "OpenAI Frontier," designed to help businesses build, deploy, and manage AI agents at scale. This platform aims to advance AI from single-point experiments to scalable, production-grade systems, with renowned enterprises like **HP, Intuit, Oracle, State Farm, Thermo Fisher Scientific, and Uber** among the first to adopt or pilot it.

    In the customer service sector, **Genesys's** AI-driven platform is leading the trend of "experience orchestration," with its AI-related Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) growing more than **twice** the rate of overall Genesys Cloud ARR. This demonstrates AI's immense potential in enhancing customer experience and operational efficiency. For example, the financial services sector is widely applying AI voice bot customer service to provide hyper-personalized customer experiences and advanced risk management.

    Simultaneously, we're seeing AI applications in human resources, such as companies like **PeopleX** offering patented AI technology for multi-language interviews, and **KLab** extending into enterprise AI creative production, both showcasing how AI can optimize specific business processes and bring innovation to enterprises.

### What Does This Mean for Us?

As ordinary citizens, our lives will become much more convenient due to these AI advancements. Imagine your AI assistant genuinely helping you with tedious shopping, or even planning itineraries and booking services. This will greatly free up our time, allowing us to focus on more interesting and valuable pursuits.

However, this also brings new questions. As AI becomes increasingly autonomous, how do we ensure the **fairness, transparency,** and **security** of its decisions? Visa's emphasis on collaborating with regulators to set standards is precisely what we need to pay attention to.

For businesses, this is an unmissable **AI investment super cycle**. Gartner predicts that global AI spending will reach an astounding **$2.52 trillion** by 2026, with an annual growth rate of **44%**. This means businesses daring to invest and leverage AI will gain stronger competitive advantages. However, high capital expenditures also raise investor concerns about returns. This **AI arms race** tests not only technological prowess but also corporate strategic vision and execution capability. As we've mentioned in a previous article, this could trigger an "AI earthquake," accelerating a reshuffle in the global software industry [/blog/2026-02-05-014239].

<Callout type="info" title="AI Accelerates Industry Transformation, Investment Requires Prudence">
  AI is accelerating strategic shifts across industries, driving corporate decisions on scale, capabilities, data, and talent. However, this may also cause capital to temporarily shift from M&A towards AI infrastructure, concentrating large deals among the most well-funded buyers.
</Callout>

The "data depletion" issue, however, reminds us that AI's development is not a smooth ride. We cannot solely pursue models that are "big" and "comprehensive"; we must also consider how to enable AI to "learn smartly," or even "self-learn." This will push AI research towards more innovative and efficiency-focused directions, such as reinforcement learning and world models.

### Insider's Deep Analysis

From my perspective as a seasoned investigative reporter, today's AI news reveals a core trend: AI is moving from "technological experiment" to "industrial reality." In the past, we might have debated what AI *could* do; now, the question is how AI *becomes* the "backbone" of enterprise operations.

Behind this, I see the AI industry undergoing an evolution "from quantitative change to qualitative transformation." On one hand, tech giants are pushing AI infrastructure to new heights with astronomical investments, much like building superhighways that allow AI data to flow faster and wider. This is why we're seeing rapid growth in Google Gemini users and cloud businesses flourishing thanks to AI.

On the other hand, the "2026 Problem" serves as a splash of cold water, reminding us to stay sober amid the frenzy. The warning of data depletion forces AI researchers to consider smarter, more efficient ways of utilizing data, such as synthetic data and miniaturized models. This will make AI development more pragmatic, shifting from pursuing "big and comprehensive" to "small and refined," allowing AI to truly penetrate more practical application scenarios, even running directly on our phones and watches, realizing true "edge AI."

I believe the launch of the OpenAI Frontier platform is precisely an embodiment of this "pragmatization." It no longer just offers a powerful model, but a set of tools to help businesses integrate AI agents into existing workflows and solve real-world problems. This signifies AI transforming from a "clever toy" into a "capable employee," and potentially even the "intelligent brain" of enterprises [/blog/2026-01-31-012646].

### One-Liner Summary

AI isn't just a "book-smart genius" anymore; it now has to "earn its keep" and learn to "scrimp and save" on data, or else its job is on the line!
