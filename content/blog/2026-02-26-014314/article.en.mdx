### What Happened?

Hey, friend! This morning, before I even finished my coffee, I was jolted awake by a piece of news: the US Department of Defense actually issued a "Friday ultimatum" to AI startup **Anthropic**! This is no laughing matter; it represents a deeper conflict—how do we weigh cutting-edge AI technology against the red lines of national security and ethics? It's like you're driving the latest self-driving car, but the government demands your vehicle comply with military production standards, or it could be "commandeered" or penalized. The story behind this is far more complex than it appears on the surface!

### Simply Put, What Is This?

Simply put, the core of today's news is this: **AI is no longer a "good kid" in the lab; it's starting to "enter society and face real-world tests."** In the past, when we talked about AI, we might have thought of it as a "super-smart tutor," helping us solve various problems. But now, it's more like a "citizen with superpowers"—its capabilities are powerful enough to influence national security, economic lifelines, and even change our daily lives. So, governments worldwide are contemplating: how should we manage this "super-powered citizen"?

The US Department of Defense's ultimatum to **Anthropic**, demanding compliance with the Defense Production Act, empowers the government to require private companies to prioritize production of defense-related materials in national emergencies. This implies that **Anthropic's Claude** model could be deemed a critical national security asset, needing inclusion under stricter regulatory scrutiny. This not only challenges **Anthropic** but also reflects the increasing sensitivity of AI model applications in military and national security domains, along with the accompanying ethical and compliance issues.

### According to Reports, Details Are as Follows

Today's AI news is truly in full swing, with not only the Pentagon's firm demands on **Anthropic**, but also global nations relentlessly pushing their AI strategies.

First, according to multiple reports, the US Department of Defense has indeed required AI company **Anthropic** to respond to inquiries regarding the use of its AI models and related regulations by today (Friday), or potentially face further action. This demand typically relates to the **Defense Production Act**, which grants the US government the power to prioritize acquiring products or services from private companies when national security needs arise. This has not only put **Anthropic** on edge but also serves as a wake-up call for all companies developing large AI models: no matter how advanced your technology, it must align with national interests and regulations. Specifically, **Anthropic's Claude** model, with its powerful language understanding and generation capabilities, holds immense potential in military intelligence analysis and strategic planning, naturally drawing high attention from the Pentagon. We've also mentioned that AI code tools could pose potential threats and opportunities, which is why a giant like **IBM** saw significant fluctuations in its stock price due to **Anthropic's** code tools threatening its core business. For details, refer to [AI Daily: The AI War Sparks! IBM Stock Plummets, Claude's Tech Stolen – What is the World Waiting For?](/blog/2026-02-24-014510).

On another front, the **White House** hasn't been idle, actively promoting its "Tech Corps" initiative aimed at expanding US influence in the global AI sector and collaborating with allies to establish AI standards and norms. This is like the US assembling a team of "AI diplomats," attempting to seize the narrative in the global AI race. Concurrently, **China** is leveraging its "AI+" initiative to deeply integrate AI with new industrialization, driving the intelligent upgrading of traditional industries. This is akin to China aiming to infuse AI technology into every facet of manufacturing to comprehensively boost productivity.

In the industry, **Nvidia** remains the superstar of the AI world! According to the latest earnings forecasts, demand for its AI chips continues to surge, with revenues once again expected to exceed market expectations. This proves that the global thirst for AI compute power is like a "bottomless pit," never satisfied. This fervor for AI hardware was something we deeply explored in previous articles, such as [AI Daily: AI Money Surges, Chip Turf Wars, Bosses Snatching Talent: What the "New Battlefield" of the AI Gold Rush Looks Like!](/blog/2026-02-25-014705), which highlighted the phenomenon of chip territory grabbing.

However, not all AI companies are sailing smoothly. AI software companies like **C3.ai**, while having promising prospects, also face business adjustments and layoff pressures. This illustrates that the AI market competition is incredibly fierce, and not every player can easily grab a piece of this big pie. Even tech giants like Amazon have adjusted some of their workforce and infrastructure strategies in response to AI expansion, demonstrating that while the AI wave brings opportunities, it also comes with organizational transformation challenges.

Regarding AI applications, **Samsung** today officially unveiled its **S26 series phones** equipped with **Galaxy AI**, integrating AI functionalities directly into our daily communication, image processing, and smart assistant services. This is like your phone no longer just being a tool, but gaining a "digital brain" that understands and helps you. Furthermore, enterprise service provider **NWN** has also strengthened its AI smart cloud services, helping corporate clients better utilize AI for management and decision-making. This proves that AI is not only changing personal lives but also reshaping business operations.

Finally, we must address the immense challenges of **AI infrastructure**. Training and running AI require astronomical amounts of compute power, leading to unprecedented pressure on **data centers**, **GPUs**, and **electricity supply**. Major tech companies, such as **Google**, **Microsoft**, and **Amazon**, are actively exploring self-sufficient power solutions and even increasing investment in "Physical AI" (referring to applying AI technology to robots, automated equipment, and the physical world). This is paving the way for AI's future development, ensuring an uninterrupted energy supply. These challenges also prompt us to consider issues like [HBM Chip Shortage Sends Giants into a Panic](/blog/2026-02-23-014733).

### Insider's Deep Analysis

From the perspective of a senior investigative journalist, I believe that behind today's AI news lies a massive "**crisis of trust and opportunity**."

Firstly, the **US Department of Defense's strong stance on Anthropic** is not just a national security concern; it's also an anxiety about the "black box" problem of AI models. The government wants to understand, control, and even, if necessary, "commandeer" these critical technologies to safeguard national interests. For AI companies, this presents both potential market opportunities (collaborating with the government) and a significant compliance challenge. In the future, AI companies will need to focus more on the transparency, explainability, and security of their models to earn the trust of both government and the public.

Secondly, the **intensification of global AI strategies** foreshadows a long-term competition intertwined with technology and geopolitics. The White House's "Tech Corps" and China's "AI+" initiatives both demonstrate that governments worldwide have recognized AI as central to future national power competition. This will drive nations to invest more resources in AI R&D, talent development, and infrastructure construction, accelerating the widespread adoption and application of AI technology.

Thirdly, **Nvidia's continued robust growth** in stark contrast to **C3.ai's business adjustments** illustrates that the AI industry is entering a phase where "hardware is king, and applications are being reshuffled." Without sufficient compute power, even the best AI models are mere castles in the air. On the application front, only AI software that genuinely solves user pain points and creates tangible value will stand out in the fierce market competition. Startups relying solely on "LLM Wrappers" and "AI aggregators"—as we mentioned in [AI Daily: Is the AI Gold Rush Fading? Google Exec Warns "Thin-Skinned" Startups Will Struggle...](/blog/2026-02-22-014636)—indeed face a crisis of obsolescence.

Finally, the **compute power and energy challenges of AI infrastructure** are colossal issues requiring a collective global response. The energy consumption of data centers not only impacts costs but also ties into climate change. Behind this, I see major tech companies tirelessly seeking breakthroughs, from chip design and cooling technologies to green energy development, all laying the foundation for AI's sustainable growth. This will also catalyze more emerging industry opportunities centered around AI energy efficiency and infrastructure optimization.
