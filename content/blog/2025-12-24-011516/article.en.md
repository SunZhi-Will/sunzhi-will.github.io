### What Happened?

Hey there, tech enthusiasts! As 2025 winds down, the AI world is absolutely buzzing! The hot gossip isn't just about which AI got smarter, but whose AI can be more "frugal"! Former Facebook privacy chief **Chris Kelly** recently revealed that the next big thing in AI development is moving the "mountains" of "efficiency" and "cost." He pointed out our brains run on just 20 watts, but AI needs to churn out gigawatt-scale data centers. Talk about a power hog!

Think he's just talking the talk? No no no! Data shows that in 2025 alone, global data center infrastructure transactions soared past **$61 billion**. And OpenAI is going all-in, planning to invest **over $1.4 trillion** in AI over the next few years, teaming up with giants like NVIDIA, Oracle, and Coreweave to build super data centers. NVIDIA and OpenAI are even planning a **10-gigawatt** data center. How jaw-dropping is that power consumption? It's roughly equivalent to the annual electricity usage of 8 million U.S. homes, or New York City's total peak electricity demand in summer 2024.

While everyone else is burning through power, China's **DeepSeek** has carved out its own path! In December 2024, they launched a free, open-source large language model for under **$6 million**, making it significantly cheaper than its American rivals! This is nothing short of an "AI cost-saving campaign"! And speaking of chips, TSMC is also scrambling to keep up with AI orders, busy expanding new fabs for 2nm, 3nm, and even 1.4nm processes. Even NVIDIA CEO **Jensen Huang** himself reportedly flew to Taiwan to "press for shipments," asking TSMC for more chips! These days, AI development is moving at light speed, and its direction is becoming much more practical.

Also, yesterday (December 23rd), a major event unfolded in the AI world, like a "clash of the titans": **OpenAI** quietly dropped **GPT-5.2**, while **Google** almost simultaneously unveiled what they call their "deepest" AI Agent. This signals that AI competition has evolved from simply "answering questions" to "solving problems independently."

### Simply Put, What Is This?

In simple terms, these latest AI developments are like hiring a bunch of super-smart employees to help us out.

First, what's an AI Agent? Imagine you're no longer just hiring an "all-knowing dictionary" to answer questions, but a whole team of interns who "run errands, think for themselves, and complete tasks independently." These AI Agents are like your digital assistants: they don't just follow orders, they plan steps, use tools, execute tasks, and even check their own work. If they mess up, they'll figure out how to retry until the job is done. Previously, AI was like a calculator – you ask one step, it answers one step; now, an AI Agent is like a project manager – you give it a goal, and it breaks it down, coordinates, executes, and finally delivers a result.

So why is Chris Kelly emphasizing "efficiency and cost"? It's like you've hired a brilliant intern team, but they're devouring your entire household's electricity supply daily, and their wages are incredibly high! Mr. Kelly means that while AI is smart, it's currently a "power monster" and a "money pit." What we need is AI that's not only clever but also "energy-saving and budget-friendly," otherwise, no matter how amazing it is, those electricity bills will bring tears to your eyes.

As for TSMC busy making chips, that's like the "brain chips" for this "AI intern team" being in short supply. The smarter and more capable AI becomes, the more powerful chips it needs to run. So, AI companies worldwide are scrambling for these high-performance chips, making TSMC, the "brain chip factory," swamped with orders.

### According to Reports, Details Are as Follows

According to the latest information, former Facebook privacy chief **Chris Kelly** explicitly stated that the next main battleground for the AI industry will focus on **improving efficiency** and **reducing costs**. He cited that the human brain operates on approximately **20 watts** of power, whereas current AI computing necessitates building high-energy-consuming data centers, with power consumption reaching gigawatt levels. This highlights the immense challenges in energy efficiency for current AI infrastructure.

Regarding infrastructure investment, the global data center market's infrastructure transaction value in 2025 has already surpassed **$61 billion**. Notably, **OpenAI** has committed to investing over **$1.4 trillion** in the AI sector in the coming years and has forged partnerships with infrastructure giants such as **NVIDIA**, **Oracle**, and **Coreweave**. It is worth noting that the data center project jointly planned by NVIDIA and OpenAI is projected to have an annual power consumption as high as **10 gigawatts**, which is equivalent to the combined annual electricity usage of **8 million U.S. households** or the total peak electricity demand of **New York City in summer 2024**.

In terms of model cost-effectiveness, Chinese startup **DeepSeek** launched an open-source large language model in December 2024, with a development cost of under **$6 million**, demonstrating a significant cost advantage compared to its U.S. competitors. Chris Kelly anticipates that with the U.S. President's approval for the sale of **NVIDIA H200 chips** to China, more Chinese enterprises will emerge, whose open-source models are expected to provide fundamental computing capabilities and drive the development of generative AI and agentic AI.

Regarding the chip supply chain, TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company), as a global leader in advanced processes, is actively expanding its capacity due to the robust growth in AI chip demand. TSMC maintains technological leadership in 2nm, 3nm, and future 1.4nm processes, described as "a league of its own," surpassing Intel and Samsung. Reports indicate that NVIDIA CEO **Jensen Huang** made a special visit to Taiwan in early November, conveying an urgent need for "more chips" to TSMC. Consequently, TSMC's supply chain, including facility engineering and equipment suppliers, has experienced immense pressure to expedite work, with equipment providers even being asked to shorten delivery schedules. Currently, TSMC is actively constructing 2nm fabs in Hsinchu Science Park and Kaohsiung, Taiwan, and expanding 2nm and 3nm capacity in Southern Taiwan Science Park. Advanced packaging fabs continue to be built and equipped in Southern Taiwan Science Park and Chiayi. Construction has also begun on the 1.4nm fab in Central Taiwan Science Park. Furthermore, regarding its overseas facilities, particularly the U.S. fabs, the first has entered mass production, the second is undergoing facility engineering, and construction has commenced on the third.

Regarding the latest advancements in AI models and Agents, Google unveiled **Gemini 3 Flash** in 2025. This model combines the superior reasoning capabilities of Gemini 3 Pro with Flash-level low latency, high efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. Google emphasized that its new generation Flash model surpasses the performance of the previous Pro model while offering lower prices and reduced latency. Concurrently, Google also introduced its "deepest" AI Agent, capable of multi-step task planning, tool utilization, and outcome verification.

**OpenAI** also released **GPT-5.2** on the same day (December 23rd). This model focuses on maintaining coherent reasoning in long and complex tasks, rather than merely improving single-sentence generation. It can act like a collaborator, questioning assumptions, breaking down goals, and adjusting plans, rather than simply responding to instructions. This simultaneous release by AI giants signals that AI competition has shifted from mere model performance to a deeper focus on **autonomous operational capabilities**.

### What Does This Mean for Us?

This shift in AI trends will have substantial impacts on all of us, whether you're an office worker, an entrepreneur, or just an everyday user:

First, the pressure for "efficiency and cost" will make **AI more accessible**. Imagine, previously only big companies with deep pockets could afford "AI super employees," because training and operational costs were simply too high. But now everyone is trying to help AI "lose weight" and "save power," meaning we're likely to see more affordable, user-friendly, and less resource-intensive AI tools in the future, accessible to everyone from small businesses to individuals.

Second, **our digital lives will become "smarter."** The rise of AI Agents means AI won't just answer questions; it will proactively help you get things done. For instance, your smart assistant might not just remind you about your calendar, but also automatically book restaurants, adjust routes based on your schedule, and even handle simple email replies. It's like your phone isn't just home to an encyclopedia, but a versatile butler.

Third, the **tech hardware industry will continue to "heat up."** TSMC's full capacity utilization and Jensen Huang personally pressing for shipments indicate that demand for high-performance AI chips will only soar. This is a massive boon for Taiwan's semiconductor industry, but it also tests the resilience of the supply chain. If you're a hardware engineer, your career prospects are simply "limitless"!

Finally, **AI ethics and governance** will become even more crucial. When AI Agents can act autonomously and physical AI enters the real world, who will be accountable for their actions? What if AI makes a mistake? These will all become serious issues that society must address. We cannot solely pursue technological advancement; we must also ensure these technologies develop within a safe and fair framework, just as we wouldn't let a robot that can drive but doesn't understand traffic rules loose on the roads.

### Insider's Deep Analysis

From an "insider's" perspective, this latest wave of AI developments actually reflects the industry entering a more mature and strategic phase.

First, the **fever of "compute-power-above-all" is cooling, replaced by considerations of "efficiency and sustainability."** In recent years, the AI world has been like an arms race, with everyone competing over who has more GPUs or larger model parameters. But as OpenAI and NVIDIA plan incredibly power-hungry, ultra-large data centers, cost and environmental issues become unavoidable realities. Chris Kelly's perspective perfectly highlights this pain point: once AI development reaches a certain level, it won't just be about benchmark scores, but about "performance per watt" and "efficiency per dollar." This presents a prime opportunity for companies with energy-saving technologies or those capable of effectively utilizing idle computing power to "overtake on the curve."

Second, the **rise of AI Agents is redefining "human-computer collaboration."** Previous AI tools were more like "hammers" in our hands; we'd use them to hit nails. But an AI Agent is like a "craftsman" with independent thought: we tell it what to build, and it plans, finds materials, and executes the work itself. Deloitte predicts that by 2026, approximately **40% of enterprise applications will embed autonomous AI agents**. This will profoundly impact corporate workflows, bringing qualitative changes across R&D, marketing, customer service, and supply chain management. What enterprise managers need to consider is no longer "what AI can do," but "how to collaborate with AI Agents and clarify accountability."

Third, the **geopolitical battle for AI chip autonomy is intensifying**. China's DeepSeek launched an open-source model at extremely low cost and is expected to see further development once H200 chips are approved for sale. This not only puts pressure on U.S. tech giants but also highlights the immense potential of the open-source ecosystem in AI popularization. On the other hand, TSMC's globally unrivaled position in advanced processes makes it a strategic battleground in geopolitics. Whoever controls the supply of the most advanced AI chips holds stronger leverage in this tech race. This will also drive countries and major corporations to invest more resources into independent AI chip R&D, reducing reliance on single suppliers.

Fourth, **AI applications are moving from virtual to physical, deepening their reach into various professional fields**. Google DeepMind's Genesis Mission allows AI to collaborate with scientists to accelerate drug discovery, and the Google Gemini Robotics model brings AI into the physical world. The Institute for Information Industry (III) has also listed **Physical AI** as one of the top ten key technologies for 2026, anticipating that humanoid robots and autonomous driving will be piloted in smart manufacturing, logistics, and care sectors. Furthermore, **specialized large models** trained for professional fields like healthcare and law will become mainstream, with AI acting as a "co-researcher" in these domains. This signifies that AI's influence will no longer be confined to computer screens but will genuinely integrate into our lives and production environments, solving more practical problems while simultaneously introducing new safety and ethical challenges.

In summary, from late 2025 to 2026, the AI industry will transition from a "wild frontier exploration phase" to a "meticulous cultivation phase." The competition won't just be about who has the fastest horse, but who can feed it well, make it run longer and more efficiently, and even deliver goods to your doorstep. This transformation will make AI more widespread and practical, yet it also imposes higher demands on corporate strategic planning, resource allocation, and risk management.

### One-Liner Summary

AI isn't just about acing exams anymore; it also needs to learn how to save power and money, while acting as your super errand runner, otherwise those electricity bills and invoices will give you a major headache!
