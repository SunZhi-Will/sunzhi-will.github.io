### What Happened?

Oh boy, if you've felt like everyone in coffee shops is buzzing about AI lately, you're not imagining it! Today, February 23, 2026, the entire AI world has seen another bombshell—or rather, several bombshells—drop! We've witnessed big players like **OpenAI** rolling out the latest model previews, and Google, not one to be outdone, quietly making their **Gemini** even smarter. But simultaneously, a hint of tension is spreading beneath the surface: the "chip shortage" that sends shivers down every tech giant's spine is back, especially for High Bandwidth Memory (HBM), which is absolutely crucial for AI training and simply cannot meet demand. It makes me think: it's like everyone's frantically building skyscrapers, but suddenly there's not enough cement to go around. A bit thrilling, wouldn't you say?

### Simply Put, What Is This?

What can you imagine these AI advancements to be like? Think of that smart robot vacuum at home: initially, it just neatly swept the floor. But now? It might have learned to plan its own routes, avoid obstacles, and even identify if a stain on your carpet is coffee or mud, then clean it using the most suitable method. This is what new models like **GPT-5** and **Gemini** are doing—making AI not just book-smart, but also capable of "thinking" and "acting."

As for the **HBM chip shortage**, it's like the "brains" of these smart robots needing vast amounts of memory to process complex tasks. Old memory was like a regular road, wide but with speed limits; HBM is like a "high-speed elevated highway," moving data both fast and in large volumes. Now everyone is rushing to build these high-speed elevated highways, but the materials for these bridges are running out. Consequently, the pace of overall AI development might just slow down. You know that frustrating feeling in an online game when all your teammates have their gear, but your ultimate item is still on backorder, right?

### According to Reports, Details Are as Follows

Today's headlines bring exciting news from **OpenAI**! They have officially unveiled the **GPT-5 preview**. While specific details are still under wraps, it's widely anticipated to be a significant leap in language model technology, showcasing unprecedented capabilities in handling complex tasks, logical reasoning, and generating more natural, contextually aware content. It feels like jumping directly from an "AI elementary student" to an "AI university student."

Meanwhile, our old friend **Google** hasn't been idle either. Their **Gemini model** has received important updates, particularly enhancing its "personal intelligence." What does this mean? Your Gemini might understand your habits and preferences better, acting more like a thoughtful personal secretary, capable of managing your schedule, summarizing information, and even offering more personalized advice. Imagine, it might even know you better than your own mother!

Furthermore, tech giants' investment in AI infrastructure is simply "boundless." **Microsoft** has announced that their investment in the AI sector has now surpassed the **ten-billion-dollar** mark. This capital isn't just for model R&D; a large portion is dedicated to building vast data centers and acquiring massive quantities of AI chips, paving the way for AI's future development. This also confirms what we've previously mentioned: global investment in AI infrastructure is continuously accelerating.

However, behind this AI gold rush, a serious problem has emerged: the **severe shortage of High Bandwidth Memory (HBM)**. As I mentioned earlier, AI chips have an enormous demand for HBM; it's like the "superhighway" for data transmission within the AI brain. Global tech companies are pouring huge investments into building AI compute power and data centers, but if HBM supply falls short, all that investment could hit a bottleneck. According to analysis, the shortage of these memory chips is already considered **one of the primary bottlenecks for AI development.** This reminds me of our previous discussions about India's data centers attracting massive capital and OpenAI partnering with Tata Group to build gigawatt-scale AI data centers; these large-scale infrastructure projects will all be directly impacted by HBM supply.

On the application front, AI's reach is also extending further and wider. From **visual AI** and **generative music** to **autonomous driving**, and even **humanoid robots** and **Physical AI** in manufacturing, these are rapidly being deployed. This signifies that AI is no longer just something on a screen; it's now "getting its hands dirty" in the real world. Imagine factory robots no longer just repeating simple movements, but making more precise judgments based on environmental changes. This will lead to a qualitative leap in our productivity. This also echoes the trend we previously discussed about "AI not just talking, but acting."

### What Does This Mean for Us?

I believe this AI wave impacts each of us on multiple levels.

**For workers**: As AI models become smarter, tools like GPT-5, capable of handling complex tasks, will automate many repetitive, low-skill jobs. At the same time, they will also create more new positions requiring "human-AI collaboration." You might need to learn how to better collaborate with AI, turning it into your super assistant. Just as you once learned to use Office software, now you'll need to learn to master AI tools.

**For businesses**: Companies that effectively leverage AI infrastructure and the latest models will gain a significant competitive advantage. However, if your company merely "wraps" large language models (colloquially known as "LLM Wrappers") or functions as an "AI aggregator" without true technological depth and specific application scenarios, you might be in danger. Google executives have previously warned that these "thin-skinned" startup enterprises will likely struggle to survive.

On the other hand, the **HBM chip shortage** is like the "compass manufacturing technology" of the Age of Discovery suddenly falling behind. If you have the largest fleet but not enough compasses, your ships cannot navigate accurately, let alone explore new continents. This HBM shortage is not just a supply chain issue; it more profoundly reflects the **semiconductor industry's underestimation of AI's explosive growth** and the **complexity and timeline of manufacturing expansion**. This will directly impact the speed of AI model training and could even delay the launch of new AI applications.

I've also observed that **AI applications are shifting from the virtual to the physical world**. Before, when we talked about AI, we might only think of writing articles or drawing pictures. Now, humanoid robots, autonomous driving, and even "Physical AI" in manufacturing are rapidly developing. This is a very significant transformation, indicating that AI is no longer just our "digital secretary"; it's becoming our "doer" in the real world. This will bring disruptive changes to traditional industries, while also sparking more discussions about robot ethics and safety regulations.

Finally, discussions about an "AI bubble" are becoming more prevalent. While giants are burning cash, Google executives' warning is certainly not groundless. **Those startups without core technology, relying solely on wrapping large models, will indeed face immense pressure.** AI has developed to a point where it's no longer an era where a novel idea alone can make money; it requires **deep technological integration**, **cultivation of specific application scenarios**, and **continuous innovation capabilities**. This is just like the dot-com bubble back then: when the tide goes out, you see who's been swimming naked.

### One-Liner Summary

AI is now not only "burning brains" for intelligence but also "burning cash" for infrastructure; yet this "highway" battle is stalled by a "cement" shortage, making things truly interesting—whoever solves the HBM problem first will seize the advantage in the next phase of the AI race!
