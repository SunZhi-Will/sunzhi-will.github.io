### What Happened?

Hey folks, it's that time of year again for some storytelling! The AI world has been absolutely wild, with big news dropping left and right, like a year-end bonus bonanza that leaves you dizzy. What's truly jaw-dropping is **China's incredible surge in generative AI**. According to China's Cyberspace Administration, over the past five years alone, more than **700 generative AI large model products** have completed registration procedures. That number sounds like they've hit the gas pedal in an AI arms race! Among them, a model named **DeepSeek** went from being virtually unknown at the beginning of the year to becoming a household AI tool in China, even described by foreign media as China's "Sputnik moment," signifying its potential to shake up the global AI industry.

Meanwhile, tech giants in Europe and the US haven't been idle either. Google's AI brain, **Gemini**, continues to evolve, with rumors even suggesting that Waymo (Google's self-driving car company) might let Gemini take the wheel of its robotaxis, making our driverless cabs even smarter. And Meta, always one for quirky moves, is now using fruit codenames like "Mango" and "Avocado" for two heavyweight AI models they're developing. Sounds very Meta, doesn't it? One focuses on images and video, while the other is a large language model, preparing to go head-to-head with OpenAI and Google in the first half of 2026.

However, amidst this seemingly bustling AI party, some buzzkills have also emerged. **Stanford University** experts threw a bucket of cold water on the excitement, predicting that 2026 will be AI's "**Year of the Reality Check**." They declared that the "missionary era" of AI is over; it's time to stop the blind hype and examine whether AI can truly deliver tangible benefits. It sounds a bit like watching cartoons as a kid: after a thrilling transformation, you always had to return to reality and face your homework.

### Simply Put, What Is This?

Let's use a few "brilliant metaphors" to explain these high-level AI technologies:

*   **Generative AI Large Models**: This is like the AI world's "**Master of Super Impersonation**." You give it a command, and it can mimic human creativity to generate new text, images, music, or even videos. China having over 700 such "impersonation masters" registered means every sector wants it to perform some magic. DeepSeek, achieving performance comparable to top international models with almost no additional computing power, is like a magician pulling off the most spectacular trick with the fewest props, leaving everyone amazed.

*   **AI Agents**: You can imagine an AI agent as your hired "**Super Intelligent Intern**." It's not just a dictionary that answers your questions (that's traditional AI); it's an intern that can plan and execute tasks on its own. For example, if you ask it to buy coffee, it won't just tell you where to find coffee; it will research online, place the order itself, and even consider your preferences. The recent development is that while the concept is great, actual deployment often "messes up" (one study points to a failure rate as high as 70%). So, now everyone is researching how to train more reliable, error-free "good interns," and how to make different "interns" collaborate effectively.

*   **Meta's "Mango" and "Avocado" Models**: This is like Meta building its own "**Super Ingredient Pantry**." "Mango" specializes in handling images and videos, acting like a movie special effects master, capable of generating various visual content. "Avocado," on the other hand, is the brain, responsible for processing text and code, like a screenwriter and programmer. Meta hopes to use these two "exclusive ingredients" to serve up its signature dish in the AI cooking competition and catch up with OpenAI and Google.

*   **Quantum AI**: This one is even cooler; you can imagine it as AI combined with **time-traveling capabilities**. Our current computers calculate "step by step," while quantum computers are like performing all possible calculations simultaneously in a "multiverse." When combined with AI, they can solve problems that our traditional computers find incredibly difficult, such as optimizing urban traffic, designing new materials, and even making AI more energy-efficient. However, for now, it's mostly "theoretical," so it won't be making your Bitcoin disappear anytime soon!

### According to Reports, Details Are as Follows

First, let's look at China's AI performance. Data from China's Cyberspace Administration shows that during the "14th Five-Year Plan" period (2021-2025), China has made new breakthroughs in integrated circuits, artificial intelligence, and basic software. As of now, **over 700 generative AI large model products** have completed registration procedures, and the number of products equipped with HarmonyOS (Hongmeng operating system) exceeds **1.19 billion units**. It's particularly worth noting that when the **DeepSeek large model** was launched at the beginning of the year, its active user count surpassed **22.15 million** within 21 days. Furthermore, it achieved performance comparable to top global AI models with relatively limited computing resources. Both domestic and international model vendors have seen rapid revenue growth. At the same time, prototypes of AI applications such as intelligent agents and robots have emerged, expected to be widely deployed between 2026 and 2027.

Regarding large tech companies:
*   **Meta** plans to launch its two new generative AI models in the first half of 2026: "**Mango**" (focused on images and video) and "**Avocado**" (a large language model aimed at improving text and code capabilities). This initiative is spearheaded by Meta's newly established Superintelligence Labs (MSL), led by Scale AI co-founder **Alexandr Wang**.
*   **Google's Gemini 2.5 series** continues to evolve, introducing "Deep Think" mode, which allows for deeper reasoning on complex problems and natively supports multimodal understanding. Additionally, Waymo may integrate Gemini into its autonomous taxis, enabling AI agents to handle ride tasks more intelligently.
*   As for **OpenAI**, its latest flagship model, **GPT-5**, has been released, boasting more advanced reasoning capabilities and multimodal functions, including a dedicated "reasoning model." OpenAI also launched **GPT Image 1.5**, claiming 4x faster image generation and more precise editing capabilities, along with a dedicated creative studio. However, there are also reports that OpenAI is considering placing advertisements within ChatGPT, which could change our experience with this AI assistant.
*   **NVIDIA** remains the dominant player in the AI chip sector and is reportedly set to acquire AI chip startup **Groq** for approximately **$20 billion**, which would be NVIDIA's largest acquisition ever. Its **Blackwell Ultra** and **800V DC** power technologies will continue to drive efficiency in AI factories. However, analysts also anticipate that NVIDIA's **80-90% market share** in the AI chip market will face challenges after 2026, as more and more companies design their own AI chips.

Regarding **AI agents**, although enterprises are highly interested, a study by Carnegie Mellon University indicates that the **failure rate of AI agents is as high as 70%**. This means that while these "intelligent interns" are theoretically powerful, they are far from perfect without human intervention. However, there are successful cases, such as IIT Delhi developing an **AI agent capable of independently conducting experiments**, Concentrix launching conversational AI agents with emotional intelligence, and Coforge's EvolveOps.AI offering 28 specialized agents for IT operations, achieving actual cost savings.

In terms of **AI ethics and challenges**, Professor **Arend Hintz** of Dalarna University in Sweden points out that current generative AI systems, lacking human supervision, tend to produce "generic, repetitive, and populist" images, severely limiting their creativity. Furthermore, an **MIT** study found that **95% of generative AI pilot projects did not yield measurable business returns**, intensifying fears of an "AI bubble." Stanford University's report explicitly states that 2026 will see "more measurement, less fantasy on AI performance," with the market establishing high-frequency AI economic dashboards to track whether AI boosts productivity, replaces labor, or creates new roles. In the medical field, the transparency, attribution, and potential biases of AI decision support systems (AI-DSS) have also raised ethical concerns.

Finally, the development of **Quantum AI** is also emerging. In 2025, Microsoft and the University of California, Santa Barbara, jointly demonstrated an **eight-qubit topological quantum processor**, a significant milestone in quantum computing. Taiwan has also established two new computing centers in Tainan, aiming to integrate quantum systems with supercomputers to promote the development and testing of quantum technology. Although quantum computing shows potential in optimization problems (such as traffic management), experts believe that its threat to cryptocurrencies in 2026 remains theoretical and is unlikely to be widely practical in the short term.

### What Does This Mean for Us?

These latest AI developments have a massive impact on us "code-illiterate" ordinary folks!

*   **Big Boost in Work Efficiency, But Also Beware of Replacement**: Imagine, struggling to write reports or prepare presentations before. Now, generative AI helps you quickly draft outlines, making a 40% increase in copywriting efficiency not a dream. Just as a survey by Dynasafe Digital shows, AI Q&A generation technology can even boost document writing efficiency by 95%, turning an hour's work into three minutes. But at the same time, once AI agents, these "super intelligent interns," become more mature, many repetitive, process-driven jobs like customer service and administrative assistants might be taken over directly by AI. This isn't about making you jobless, but about requiring you to enhance your "dancing with AI" skills to handle complex emotional and creative tasks that AI can't manage.

*   **Richer Entertainment Experiences, But "Authenticity" Is Questionable**: If Meta's "Mango" model can master images and videos, our TV shows and movie special effects will become even more realistic. We might even see an explosion of personalized virtual idols and exclusive AI-generated content. However, the limitations of generative AI in creativity are also apparent; it tends to produce "formulaic" content, lacking true originality. This is like AI crafting fast food specifically for you—delicious and convenient, but always missing a bit of that "human touch" emotion. In the future, we may need to sharpen our eyes even more to distinguish between genuine human expression and AI's "canned" creations.

*   **Greater Life Convenience, But Increased Privacy and Security Risks**: AI agents manage your schedule, automate orders, and even Waymo's self-driving taxis intelligently get you to your destination—all raising convenience to new heights. But simultaneously, these AI models require massive amounts of data to learn and perform tasks. Will your personal data be misused? Is AI's decision-making process a "black box" that we can't understand? These are all issues we need to pay attention to. Just as Stanford University warns, AI might not only be convenient but also misleading or even harmful.

*   **Industry Investment Opportunities Coexist with Bubble Risks**: For investors, the explosion of AI in China, NVIDIA's continued strength, and the rise of new AI chip companies represent immense business opportunities. But the MIT study also warns that 95% of generative AI projects show no return. This is like a gold rush: some strike it rich, while others might just be wasting their efforts. Therefore, when investing in AI concept stocks, one shouldn't just chase the hype but also look for genuine problem-solving capabilities.

### Insider's Deep Analysis

From the perspective of a seasoned investigative reporter, several profound business logics in the AI world at the close of 2025 are worth pondering.

Firstly, **China's AI is advancing in both quantity and quality, reshaping the global landscape**. In the past, discussions about AI often revolved around Western giants. But this time, over 700 model registrations, coupled with cases like DeepSeek demonstrating "low computing power, high intelligence," show that the Chinese market has forged its own path in AI application popularization and cost-effectiveness. This isn't just about catching up technologically but also about the maturation of an industrial ecosystem. They are deeply integrating AI into various industries, from healthcare and law to manufacturing, where AI's presence is evident. For companies in other countries, this is both a challenge and a lesson: how to rapidly iterate at the application layer and find AI implementation models suitable for their own markets will be key.

Secondly, **large tech companies are shifting from an "arms race" to "precision strikes."** Meta, having lagged slightly in generative AI, is now launching "Mango" and "Avocado," clearly aimed at reinforcing multimodal content generation and core language model capabilities. This indicates that the competition among AI giants is no longer just about who has larger model parameters or stronger computing power; instead, it focuses more on **deep cultivation of specific application scenarios** and **strategic deployment of foundational models**. Google's Gemini strengthening multimodal and agent capabilities, and its potential integration into Waymo, also extends its AI advantage from cloud intelligence to embodied AI applications in the physical world. The next phase of this competition will be about who can transform "general capabilities" into "unique products."

Furthermore, **while AI agents are a future trend, their maturity is far below expectations, and the market needs more pragmatic expectations**. A 70% failure rate is a stark warning. It tells us that making AI think and act autonomously like humans is harder than imagined. Current AI agents are more like "clumsy apprentices with toolboxes," requiring human supervision and guidance. Therefore, **providing "tools" rather than "replacements"** and **emphasizing "human-AI collaboration" rather than "full replacement"** will be the pragmatic path for AI agent development in the coming years. Companies that can develop "useful and unobtrusive" AI auxiliary tools, rather than those who merely talk about "ultimate AI," are more likely to succeed.

Finally, **AI's "bubble" and "ethics" issues will become the keywords of 2026**. Stanford University's "reality check" prediction directly hits at the core of the current AI craze. When 95% of AI projects show no actual returns, it suggests that many companies' AI investments might merely be chasing trends rather than genuinely solving pain points. Simultaneously, the limitations of generative AI's creativity, as well as the ethical dilemmas concerning AI in medical decisions and personal privacy, remind us that technological development must go hand-in-hand with social responsibility. Whoever can better establish AI governance frameworks and ensure AI's fairness, transparency, and explainability will win society's trust and gain a prominent position in long-term development. This is a comprehensive game involving technology, business, and social values.

### One-Liner Summary

In 2025's AI scene, China unleashed an "AI clone army," while Western giants gorged on "fruit feasts" to catch up. But Stanford coldly dropped a bombshell: Don't celebrate too soon, next year is when "AI tells the truth"!
