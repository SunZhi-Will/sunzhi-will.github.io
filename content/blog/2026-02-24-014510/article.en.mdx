### What Happened?

I must say, today's AI news is like a high-octane tech drama! 🎬 First, a headline exploded on Wall Street: tech giant **IBM**'s stock **plunged by 13%** on Monday (February 23rd), marking its largest single-day drop since 2000! And the culprit? Another AI startup, **Anthropic**. Their new tool directly challenged IBM's most core and profitable "legendary" business. Imagine, a decades-old established company suddenly getting cold feet from a newcomer's "new weapon"—isn't this a real-life "David and Goliath" story?

But that's not all. On the very same day, **Anthropic** itself became headline news, though this time, they were the "victims" of theft. They publicly accused three Chinese AI companies—**DeepSeek**, **Moonshot AI**, and **MiniMax**—of massively stealing capabilities from their flagship chatbot, **Claude**, using a method called "distillation technique." This essentially elevates the intellectual property issue directly to a national security level!

### Simply Put, What Is This?

Let's use an analogy to understand these two events.

First, IBM's stock crash. You can imagine **IBM** as an old-school "car manufacturer" that has for decades made money by building super-durable yet complex "commercial trucks" (which are **mainframe systems** running COBOL programs). These trucks are the backbone of global banks, insurance companies, and government agencies. Now, **Anthropic** is like a company that released an "AI autonomous driving retrofit kit"! Their **Claude Code** tool claims it can modernize these old COBOL trucks quickly and automatically, without spending years and hiring "hundreds of thousands of technicians" (the former consulting teams) for repairs and upgrades. Investors, hearing that the maintenance market for these old trucks might be disrupted, naturally panicked and rushed to sell IBM shares.

<StatsHighlight

  stats={[{value: "13%", label: "IBM's single-day stock drop"}, {value: "95%", label: "Global ATM transactions still rely on COBOL"}, {value: "80%", label: "Global in-person transactions still rely on COBOL"}]}
/>

As for Anthropic's intellectual property dispute, you can imagine **Claude** as a "master chef" who painstakingly developed a secret recipe dish. Now, several competitors, instead of learning to cook directly, sneak into the kitchen, repeatedly taste the dish, record its flavors and textures, and then try to recreate a "very similar-tasting but much cheaper" knock-off using cheaper ingredients. This is the "**distillation technique**"—using the outputs of a superior model to train a less capable one, quickly enhancing the latter's abilities. Anthropic angrily stated that these competitors even "disguised themselves" (using fake accounts) to exploit loopholes, which isn't just stealing a recipe, but industrial-scale espionage!

### According to Reports, Details Are as Follows

The details of both these events are quite thought-provoking.

First, let's look at IBM's situation. Anthropic claims their **Claude Code** tool can help enterprises "modernize" traditional systems running on **COBOL** (Common Business-Oriented Language). Why is this important? Because COBOL, though old, is the lifeline of critical infrastructure globally in finance, government, and other sectors! Statistics show that about **95%** of global ATM transactions and **80%** of in-person transactions are still processed by COBOL systems. Historically, upgrading these systems required **years** and an "army of consulting experts." But now, Anthropic says **Claude Code** can automate the "discovery and analysis" phase, which used to be the most time-consuming and labor-intensive part. Investors clearly saw the huge threat AI poses to IBM's traditional consulting services and mainframe business, leading to the **13%** single-day stock plunge, its largest since October 2000. This "AI-driven panic selling" also affected other software and payment companies like **Microsoft**, **CrowdStrike**, **DoorDash**, and **American Express**, whose stock prices also fell.

Next are Anthropic's accusations. On February 24th, US AI company **Anthropic** publicly stated that they discovered three Chinese AI companies—**DeepSeek**, **Moonshot AI**, and **MiniMax**—were extensively stealing capabilities from their chatbot **Claude** through "**distillation techniques**." They claim these companies created about **24,000 fake accounts** and engaged in over **16 million interactions** with Claude, thereby circumventing service terms and regional access restrictions. Among them, **MiniMax** had the largest scale of activity, with over **13 million interactions**. The stolen capabilities primarily focused on areas where Claude excels, including **code generation**, **agentic reasoning**, and **tool use**.

Anthropic further indicated that this illegal distillation constitutes a "**national security risk**." Models trained through illicit means could potentially lack necessary safety mechanisms, and if used to develop bioweapons or launch cyberattacks, the consequences would be unimaginable. This also circumvents US "export controls" aimed at maintaining its dominant position in the AI field. Notably, **OpenAI** also made similar accusations against **DeepSeek** earlier in February. However, some critics have countered, pointing out that **Anthropic** and **OpenAI** themselves have been accused of using copyrighted data without permission when training their models, making their stance appear somewhat "hypocritical."

<Callout type="info" title="The Grey Area of AI Intellectual Property">
"Distillation technique" itself isn't entirely illegal in AI development; many companies use it to develop lightweight versions of their own models. However, when used by competitors to "leapfrog" others by replicating core capabilities at extremely low cost, it crosses the intellectual property red line. This highlights the enormous challenge of defining and protecting intellectual property in the age of AI.
</Callout>

Facing these challenges, the "ethics and governance" of AI also remain a focus. The **American Enterprise Institute (AEI)** in the US established an **AI Ethics Committee** on February 23rd, aiming to "balance innovation with human dignity." This committee will provide practical resources, hoping to foster prudence and responsibility alongside technological development, ensuring AI development promotes human well-being. Furthermore, a webinar held on February 24th also focused on "Strategies for Ethics and Compliance Professionals in the Age of AI," emphasizing the importance of understanding global AI regulations, assessing risks, and leveraging AI tools to enhance compliance efficiency.

In terms of talent and education transformation, the US **Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS)** has allocated **$4,184,695** for fiscal year 2025 to support **AI literacy and integration projects** in museums and libraries nationwide. This initiative aims to expand AI education beyond traditional classrooms, allowing more Americans to access and acquire AI skills. Concurrently, **OpenAI Academy** launched an introductory **Codex course** for **non-technical professionals** on February 24th, which is undoubtedly good news for those without deep programming backgrounds but wishing to learn AI programming. The UK government is also actively investing, planning to enhance the AI skills of **10 million adults** by **2030** through free AI training courses, equipping the entire populace to adapt to the AI era.

### What Does This Mean for Us?

These AI news stories have profound implications for each of us.

First, **IBM's turmoil** serves as a wake-up call for all traditional enterprises. It tells us that the disruptive power of AI is coming faster and more directly than we imagined. Those "iron rice bowls" that felt secure might be replaced overnight by AI's "digital tools." If your current job still involves repetitive, routine tasks, you really need to quickly consider how to improve your AI literacy and cross-domain capabilities. AI isn't here to steal your job; it's here to change *how* you work.

Second, the **AI intellectual property tug-of-war** has even deeper implications. This isn't just a commercial competition between tech companies; it concerns international technological dominance and national security. When the core capabilities of a top AI model are "distilled" and fall into malicious hands, a "replicated AI" lacking safety protocols could be used for nefarious purposes, such as developing bioweapons or cyberattacks – a chilling thought. This also means that in the future, our "trust" in AI content will be more cautious, as you won't know if there's an undertone of "unjust enrichment."

At the same time, the **advancement of AI ethics and governance** is like attaching a safety belt to AI development. The establishment of the ethics committee by the American Enterprise Institute, and global discussions on AI regulations, all aim to ensure that AI development does not deviate from a "human-centric" purpose. This is good news for us, meaning that future AI products we use are likely to consider fairness, transparency, and privacy protection from their initial design.

Finally, **AI talent and education transformation** represent opportunities for personal development. Whether you're a student, a working professional, or a retiree, there's now an opportunity to learn AI through various resources. **IMLS** is bringing AI to museums and libraries, **OpenAI Academy** is offering non-technical courses, and the UK government's plan to upskill **10 million people** in AI skills all tell us: learning AI is no longer solely for programmers; it's a required skill for every modern citizen. Just as learning to use a computer was once essential, learning how to "harness" AI will determine your competitiveness in future society.

### Insider's Deep Analysis

From an investigative journalist's perspective, I believe today's AI news reveals several key trends.

First, **AI is accelerating "industry restructuring."** IBM's stock plunge is not just a challenge to its own business model, but a microcosm of the entire traditional software services industry. AI's efficiency and cost advantages are forcing companies to shift from "labor-intensive" service models to "AI-driven" solutions. This also confirms economist **Nassim Taleb's** warning: AI-driven markets are fragile, and the software industry could face volatility and even a wave of bankruptcies. I see this as AI constantly eroding the "moats" of traditional enterprises, compelling them to undergo profound transformations, or else be eliminated by the market. This also echoes our previous discussion on "thin-skinned startups struggling to survive."

Second, **international AI competition has shifted from "technological innovation" to an "intellectual property offense and defense battle."** Anthropic's accusations against Chinese companies are not merely commercial disputes but a strategic component of the US's efforts to consolidate its leading position in AI and prevent technology outflow. The so-called "distillation technique," while a common method in AI development, becomes a national-level sensitive issue in cross-border competition when it involves large-scale, unauthorized "borrowing." This also highlights the new meaning of "export controls" in the AI era—they are no longer limited to hardware chips but extend to the flow of model capabilities and knowledge. The **TRAIN Act** and **CLEAR Act** proposed by the US Congress, demanding transparency in AI training data, are concrete manifestations of this battle, attempting to build a defense from a legal standpoint.

Finally, the **popularization of AI and talent cultivation are critical to shaping the future AI landscape.** Whether it's IMLS promoting AI literacy in museums and libraries, or OpenAI Academy opening Codex courses for non-technical individuals, it shows that AI is moving from the laboratories of a few elites to the general public. The UK government's ambitious goal is also a microcosm of the global AI talent war. Whoever can cultivate "AI-savvy" talent faster and more broadly will gain an advantage in the future AI world. I believe this is not just a competition of technology, but a competition for "talent dividends."

### One-Liner Summary

Today's AI world tells us: stop treating AI like a sci-fi movie plot; it has burst into reality, not only terrifying established giants but also igniting international tech warfare, and subtly changing how each of us learns and works. Fail to get on board now, and you might miss the chance to "catch the train" altogether in the future! ⚡️
