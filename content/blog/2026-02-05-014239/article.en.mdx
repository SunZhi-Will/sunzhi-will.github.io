### What Happened?

Hey everyone, has the tech world felt like a thrilling rollercoaster ride lately? 🎢 I've been watching closely and the entire market feels like a stark contrast of 'ice and fire'! On one hand, AI's potential has everyone buzzing with excitement, with new products and investments emerging constantly. On the other, the anxiety surrounding AI's potential 'industry reshuffle,' especially its impact on traditional software, hangs like a dark cloud over the market.

Take the past few days, for instance: global software stocks have plummeted, quite alarmingly. I've seen many software companies' share prices go into a 'freefall,' with hundreds of billions of dollars in market value evaporating in an instant. This isn't because they're performing poorly, but because investors are starting to worry: 'Is AI coming to take our jobs?' This concern has cast a huge question mark over the valuation of the software industry.

Yet, simultaneously, tech giants that command core AI technologies and infrastructure are behaving like they're in an arms race, lavishly spending huge sums to accelerate investments in AI chips and data centers. These two vastly different market reactions truly make me feel that 2026 will be a pivotal year where AI defines a new order.

### Simply Put, What Is This?

Imagine your 'omnipotent' digital butler at home. Now, it doesn't just listen to your commands; it has learned to 'think proactively' and 'take action to help you with tasks.' Before, you might have had to teach it step-by-step how to do things. Now, it can understand your intentions, even anticipate your needs, and get things done for you. This is the 'qualitative leap' that AI is currently making.

Traditional software was like a 'recipe' with predefined steps. You followed it step-by-step to create a fixed dish. But today's AI is more like a 'super chef' that not only cooks but also invents new dishes, refines recipes, and can even customize delicious meals you've never imagined, based on your taste preferences.

This has led to two outcomes:
1.  **The value of 'recipes' is being re-evaluated**: When a super chef emerges, 'recipe software' that merely follows instructions naturally faces challenges, as AI can likely do it better, faster, and cheaper.
2.  **'Kitchens' and 'ingredients' become more valuable**: To sustain so many super chefs, you need top-tier kitchens (data centers) and high-quality ingredients (AI chips). So, it's no surprise that investors are pulling money from 'recipe companies' and redirecting it into 'kitchen and ingredient suppliers'.

<Callout type="info" title="The Rise of Agentic AI Capabilities">
Do you remember our previous article, 'AI Doesn't Just 'Listen' Anymore, It Now 'Takes Action to Help You': Agentic AI and the Serviceification Wave Sweeping the Globe!'? [AI Doesn't Just 'Listen' Anymore, It Now 'Takes Action to Help You': Agentic AI and the Serviceification Wave Sweeping the Globe!](/blog/2026-02-02-014709) Today's developments are a concrete manifestation of this trend, with AI transforming from a passive assistant into an 'agent' capable of proactively completing complex tasks.

### According to Reports, Details Are as Follows

AI news these past two days has been almost entirely dominated by a few major companies. Let me tell you some specific details I've observed:

**1. Software Stock Volatility: AI's 'Decentralization' Threat?**

First up is the software industry's 'AI anxiety.' According to **CNBC**, share prices of U.S. software companies have fallen sharply due to concerns that AI will disrupt traditional software businesses, and this wave of panic has spread to Asian markets. Companies like Japan's TIS, Trend Micro, and India's Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, among others, have all seen significant declines.

Why is this happening? Because AI legal tools, like those launched by **Anthropic**, can now automate routine tasks in professional legal services such as contract review and NDA screening. This is essentially having AI act as a 'super intern,' directly impacting the pricing power and market position of these professional service software providers. Subscription-based software (SaaS), once considered a golden rice bowl, is now also facing re-evaluation pressure.

However, **Nvidia** CEO **Jensen Huang** views this quite openly. He publicly stated that worrying about AI replacing software tools is 'illogical,' because AI will be an 'end-user of existing software,' not a 'rebuilder.' His point is that AI will utilize existing software, making them more powerful, rather than building an entirely new world from scratch. This statement somewhat offered a shot in the arm to the market, but the structural challenges for the software industry persist.

**2. Tech Giants Splurge Billions: Is AI Hardware the New King?**

While software stocks were falling, **Google**'s parent company, **Alphabet**, announced a staggering capital expenditure plan. They anticipate investing a colossal **$175 billion to $185 billion** in capital expenditure in 2026! This is significantly higher than analysts' expectations of $115 billion, even surpassing their total spending over the past three years combined. These funds will primarily be allocated to building AI servers, data centers, and related infrastructure. Google CEO **Sundar Pichai** emphasized that these AI investments and infrastructure are broadly driving revenue and growth.

<StatsHighlight
  title="Alphabet's Projected 2026 AI Capital Expenditure"
  stats={[{value: "$175 billion - $185 billion", label: "Tens of billions higher than analyst expectations"}]}
/>

This also reflects that hardware investment is absolutely essential to support the massive computational demands of large AI models. Beyond Google, Taiwan's chip design giant **MediaTek** is also shining brightly in the AI chip sector. They project that their data center Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) business will account for **20%** of the company's total revenue next year (2027), and this business is expected to contribute **$1 billion** in revenue this year (2026). What's more interesting is that MediaTek is reportedly developing TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) for Google and has already partnered with **Nvidia** to design the **GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip** for Nvidia's **DGX Spark** supercomputer.

This reminds me of our previous mention in [AI Melee: Microsoft, Google, OpenAI Battle for AI Supremacy, Your Home Assistant Is Getting Smarter Too!](/blog/2026-01-27-012349), where the competition among these tech giants in the AI domain has extended from software applications to the more foundational hardware infrastructure.

**3. AI Applications Blossom: From Assistants to Development Tools**

At the application level, AI continues to evolve and integrate into our daily lives. **Amazon**'s **Alexa+** has officially rolled out to US users. This smart assistant, powered by generative AI, not only enables more natural conversations but also boasts a 'memory' function, allowing it to recall your preferences and maintain conversational context. What's even cooler is its 'agentic capabilities,' enabling it to directly book rides, order food, and even browse websites to complete complex tasks. If you're an Amazon Prime member, this upgraded Alexa+ is free; non-members will need to pay **$19.99** per month.

Meanwhile, **Anthropic**'s **Claude Code** has also caused a sensation in the software development world. It can now not only suggest code but also directly write, test, debug, and deploy it. According to reports, as much as **30%** of **Microsoft**'s code and over **25%** of **Google**'s code is now completed by AI. This indicates that AI has evolved from an assistive tool into a true 'co-developer'.

**4. The Double-Edged Sword of the Labor Market: Job Displacement and New Opportunities Coexist**

Of course, the rapid development of AI has also prompted deep reflection on the labor market. A survey by **Resume.org** reveals that **60%** of U.S. companies plan to reduce their workforce in 2026 due to automation and AI. It's projected that by the end of 2026, **37%** of companies will use AI to replace some positions. Roles with high repetitiveness and clear rules, such as administrative work, entry-level data processing, and basic customer service, are facing the risk of reduction.

<Callout type="info" title="AI's Impact and Transformation on the Labor Market">
This aligns perfectly with the perspectives in our previous article, '[AI Daily] AI Isn't Just a Smart Brain, It's Also a Boss Facing Labor Shortages! Talent, Chips, and Risks: An Early 2026 AI Stocktake' [AI Isn't Just a Smart Brain, It's Also a Boss Facing Labor Shortages! Talent, Chips, and Risks: An Early 2026 AI Stocktake](/blog/2026-02-04-012935). AI is reshaping talent demand, requiring both companies and individuals to rethink their skill sets.
</Callout>

However, this isn't entirely bad news. AI will also create a plethora of new, high-value positions. It's projected that by 2030, **170 million** new AI-related jobs will be added globally, achieving a net gain of **78 million** between 2025 and 2030. For instance, AI/ML Engineers, Prompt Engineers, AI Ethics and Governance Specialists—these roles, which didn't exist a few years ago, are now becoming market darlings.

<StatsHighlight

  stats={[
    {value: "37%", label: "Companies expected to replace some positions with AI in 2026"},
    {value: "170 million", label: "New AI-related jobs globally by 2030"},
    {value: "90%", label: "Companies will face critical skill shortages in 2026"},
    {value: "28%", label: "Average salary increase for professionals with AI skills"}
  ]}
/>

But the question remains: are our workers prepared to meet these new challenges and opportunities? By 2026, **90%** of organizations will face severe skill shortages. AI-related skills are evolving **66%** faster than those for other roles. Therefore, continuous learning and embracing AI technology are no longer options—they are necessities.

### What Does This Mean for Us?

I believe the most direct impact is that everyone's 'digital assistant' will become smarter than ever before. Imagine speaking with Alexa, and she no longer responds stiffly but genuinely like a real friend who understands your emotions and needs. She could help you manage more complex daily tasks, such as itinerary planning, smart home control, and even become your health management partner. This will make our lives more convenient, but it also challenges us on how to coexist with such a 'super-intelligent' AI.

For businesses, this means a significant increase in efficiency, but it also brings pressure for model transformation. Software companies that previously profited from 'information asymmetry' and 'repetitive services' must now rethink their core value. They either embrace AI, integrating it into their products to create new value, or they risk being replaced by new AI-native tools.

And for us office workers, the biggest impact is undoubtedly the pressure of 'learning' and the opportunity for 'transformation.' If you're still doing a lot of highly repetitive, routine work, then you truly need to be vigilant. AI will be a powerful assistant, but it will also take those 'lower-tier' jobs. However, this also means we can focus our energy on more creative, more strategic tasks, acting as AI's 'conductor' rather than being the 'performer' it replaces.

### Insider's Deep Analysis

From the perspective of a veteran investigative journalist, I see the market turmoil triggered by AI as essentially a 'great capital migration.' Over the past decade, the Software as a Service (SaaS) model proved its astonishing profitability, attracting massive investment. But now, the advent of AI poses a severe challenge to this business logic.

> "Software once ate the world; now Wall Street fears AI will eat software." — Morningstar

This statement precisely encapsulates the current market anxiety. When AI can directly generate code and automate services, how much 'subscription fee' can traditional software still command? Will its value be redefined? This is why companies like **Alphabet** and **MediaTek** are choosing to invest heavily in AI chips and data centers. They understand that in the AI era, core competitiveness is shifting from 'software applications' to 'underlying computing power.' Whoever controls the most critical AI hardware and infrastructure will hold the power in the future. This doesn't mean software is no longer important; rather, 'software' needs to be redefined. It will increasingly depend on robust AI infrastructure and present itself in the form of 'AI as a Service'.

/>

Behind this arms race also lies a greater risk. The computational and memory demands of AI are growing at an alarming rate, leading to a tight semiconductor supply chain. A **TrendForce** report indicates that, driven by AI, hard disk drive (HDD) production for 2026 is already fully booked. Furthermore, some analyses predict that AI memory prices could soar by **50-55%** by 2026. This will directly impact the cost of AI development and could make it unaffordable for smaller AI companies, further exacerbating market centralization.

### One-Liner Summary

AI is no longer just a 'book-smart genius'; it now has to 'earn a living,' and its 'rice bowl' might shift from software to hardware, while even our 'jobs' need to 'level up' alongside AI!
