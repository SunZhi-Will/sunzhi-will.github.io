### What Happened?

Hey, have you noticed your workflow suddenly feels different this morning? Or perhaps someone around you quietly left the company, but you haven't heard about any mass layoffs? I've recently observed a phenomenon we call "quiet firing"—it's not a traditional layoff, but rather companies gradually marginalizing employees, reducing resources, and withholding training, leading employees to voluntarily leave. Behind this trend, the introduction of **Artificial Intelligence** (AI) is undeniably a key driver. AI isn't just taking over basic tasks; it's acting like a watershed, propelling those who keep pace forward, while those who can't are silently phased out by the era.

Simultaneously, the global AI race has entered a white-hot phase. Imagine, this isn't just a contest of technological prowess; it's a geopolitical chess match! Microsoft's president's warning highlights a battle that could determine future tech hegemony. And surprisingly, the battlefield for this conflict is in places we might least expect.

### Simply Put, What Is This?

I think AI right now is like a brilliant student who just got into university. It has unlimited potential and can help you with a lot of things, from writing reports and creating charts to processing complex data. But this super-achiever is also quite "picky." It needs top-tier computer equipment (AI infrastructure), vast amounts of learning material (data), and the best teachers (AI researchers) to guide it. If you can't learn to collaborate with this prodigy, or if you don't provide enough resources, then I'm sorry to say, you might be outshone by it, or even abandoned by the "school" (company).

"Quiet firing" is like those university students who fall behind: the professor stops giving them extra tutoring, no longer assigns important projects, and eventually, the student withdraws themselves. It's not that the professor kicked them out, but they felt unable to adapt. And the global AI competition is like an Olympic Games, where every country is investing massive resources to train its own AI athletes. Whoever wins more gold medals will have a greater voice on the global stage.

### According to Reports, Details Are as Follows

According to today's reports, **Artificial Intelligence**'s impact on the labor market is becoming increasingly profound, leading to a rise in "quiet firing." Companies are tending to phase out employees who fail to keep up with AI technological advancements, undoubtedly placing an urgent demand on employees for retraining and skill transformation. This also confirms what we discussed previously: AI is no longer just thinking; now it's "getting its hands dirty," and its impact on the labor market cannot be underestimated.

At the same time, the global AI race continues to heat up. **Microsoft's President** warns that the US could fall behind China in AI competition, especially in **emerging markets** outside of North America and Europe. This isn't groundless; China's **open-source, low-cost AI models**, such as **DeepSeek** and **Alibaba Cloud's Qwen**, are rapidly expanding in emerging markets, backed by large-scale government subsidies, giving them an advantage in cost and market penetration. This makes me wonder if the criteria for winning this race isn't just about advanced technology, but also about who can reach and serve the masses more quickly and widely.

The construction of AI infrastructure is also accelerating globally. To cope with the explosive growth of AI workloads, the **Philippines** is collaborating with **Cisco** to expand its AI infrastructure. This is like continuously upgrading network and computer equipment to ensure the prodigy runs smoothly. On the other hand, **OpenAI** has also reached a **multi-billion dollar** agreement with **Cerebras Systems** to procure computing power, aiming to reduce reliance on major cloud service providers and seek **diversified computing power sources**. This tells us that even AI giants are thinking about how "not to put all their eggs in one basket" to ensure a stable future supply of computing power.

  ]}

In terms of ethics and governance, Australian unions and Microsoft have signed an agreement emphasizing the need to safeguard **labor rights** and **employee voices** in AI development. This is a very important milestone, meaning that AI development should not only consider technological aspects but also human well-being. The Hong Kong government is also considering using its **budget** to formulate comprehensive **AI policies** to strike a balance between innovation and regulation. This is like putting a saddle and reins on a runaway horse, guiding it effectively while it gallops.

<Callout type="info" title="AI Ethics and Governance Become a Global Focus">
As AI technology rapidly develops, governments, businesses, and unions worldwide are recognizing the importance of establishing clear AI ethical guidelines and governance frameworks to ensure AI development is responsible and beneficial to society.
</Callout>

Finally, AI technology continues to demonstrate astonishing progress in various industrial applications and innovations. For instance, AI is being used for **grid optimization** to enhance transmission capacity, much like making the power company's brain smarter to distribute electricity more efficiently. AI is also applied to transform **food waste into sustainable protein**, which is practically magic turning kitchen scraps into gold. In manufacturing, the introduction of **compact, high-performance AI models** is making production lines smarter and more efficient. These applications prove that AI is no longer just a concept in the laboratory; it has permeated every aspect of our lives.

### What Does This Mean for Us?

I believe the most direct impact is that our "rice bowls" are no longer as secure as they once were. You might ask, will AI take my job? My view is that AI won't directly take *your* job, but it **will take the jobs of those who don't use AI or don't know how to collaborate with AI**. If you're still stuck in old work patterns, unwilling to learn new AI tools and skills, then you genuinely face the risk of "quiet firing."

For businesses, this is a talent war. Companies that can quickly embrace AI and cultivate new skills in their employees will gain an advantage in this transformation. Conversely, businesses that cling to old ways risk being marginalized in market competition.

From a national perspective, winning or losing the AI race isn't just about economic strength; it's also about international influence. Whoever masters leading AI technology will occupy a favorable position in the future global landscape. This is why governments worldwide are actively investing resources to promote AI development and formulate relevant policies.

### Insider's Deep Analysis

What I see behind this is essentially a process of global resource reallocation. Previously, everyone competed on who had stronger hardware, more money, and could buy the most and best chips. But now, the rules of this game are changing. The rise of **open-source AI models**, especially ones like China's **DeepSeek** and **Qwen**, are rapidly conquering new ground in emerging markets with lower costs and faster speeds. This is akin to the challenge open-source software once posed to Microsoft Windows, shifting the market landscape.

This also explains why **OpenAI** is investing billions of dollars to partner with **Cerebras Systems**, seeking to diversify its computing power sources. This isn't just about ensuring technological leadership; it's also about strategic security and cost reduction. If computing power sources become too concentrated in the future, it could lead to extreme passivity amidst international political shifts.

> "The future of AI is not defined by a single giant, but by an open ecosystem, diversified computing power, and inclusive applications."

Another trend worth noting is the development of "physical AI" and "edge AI," which gained significant attention at this year's **CES 2026**. This signifies that AI will no longer exist solely in the cloud or large data centers; it will integrate more deeply into our daily lives, from smart home appliances to factory robots, becoming ubiquitous. This also means that the demand for data privacy, security, and ethical governance will become even more urgent.

The agreement between Australian unions and Microsoft is like laying a crucial foundation for labor rights in the AI era. It demonstrates that social equity and worker well-being should not be sacrificed in the pursuit of technological progress. This also sets a precedent for other countries and businesses.

### One-Liner Summary

AI is no longer just a "book-smart genius"; it now has to "earn a living," and it's competing for territory with brilliant students worldwide. What you and I can do is quickly learn to "work alongside it"!
