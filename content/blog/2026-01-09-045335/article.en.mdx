### What Happened?

Today (January 9, 2026), the AI world is simply a "multi-front battle"! Besides our familiar AI assistants getting smarter, they're now even "physicalizing" from the virtual world to walk among us. From major nations scrambling to set AI rules, to companies racing to develop "running and jumping" robots, and a Chinese AI startup shining brightly on the Hong Kong stock market, market funds are still brimming with enthusiasm for AI. However, this wave of AI also brings new workplace anxiety: research finds that AI "upgrades" our jobs, but our workload increases, and our pay stays the same. It's like the company hired a super-smart intern, and everyone else ended up working overtime, but the boss thought everyone was getting off easy!

### Simply Put, What Is This?

Today's AI news revolves around several core concepts. Let's explain them with some brilliant metaphors:

1.  **"Physical AI" and "Embodied Intelligence"**: Imagine that previously, AI was like a **super-smart strategist**, only responsible for thinking and strategizing. It could write articles, draw pictures, and analyze data, but it couldn't actually "do" anything. The "physical AI" and "embodied intelligence" now being discussed are like that strategist not only having ideas but also being able to command a group of **"soldiers that can walk, run, and carry things."** These soldiers are AI-powered robots that can understand the physical world and actually execute tasks, such as assembling products in a factory or delivering goods to your doorstep. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said at CES 2026 that this is the next wave of AI. It's like we mentioned before, your "AI intern" is truly about to [physicalize](/blog/2026-01-08-011829)!

2.  **"Computing Power" Infrastructure**: This is like the AI world's **super power plants and highways**. AI needs vast electricity and computing power to perform calculations and learn. "East Data West Computing" is the Chinese government's strategy to balance resources by having the data computing demands of the east handled by the energy-rich west, much like building a city's power plant in a remote area and then transmitting electricity back to the city via high-voltage lines. In this "AI power race," even Tesla CEO Elon Musk said that China has an advantage in power expansion and will "greatly surpass" other countries in AI computing power.

3.  **"AI Agents" and "Super Apps"**: If you consider AI a versatile toolkit, then "AI Agents" are the **tools in the toolbox that can act on their own**. They don't just wait for your command; they can proactively assess, plan, and complete a series of complex tasks, much like your ["errand boy" gradually evolving into a "presidential assistant"](/blog/2026-01-03-011320). "Super apps," on the other hand, are like **one app that handles everything**, integrating various AI functions so you no longer need to switch between different applications. For example, Google has integrated AI features into Gmail, allowing your inbox to summarize emails and suggest replies.

### According to Reports, Details Are as Follows

Several major news items today are worth noting:

*   **China's AI Governance and Cooperation**: China Media Group, along with several other institutions, released the "2026 Top Ten AI Trends," explicitly stating that "AI governance globalization" has become a core issue. It highlighted China's proposal to establish a **"World Artificial Intelligence Cooperation Organization,"** hoping to provide "public goods" in global development strategies, governance rules, and technical standards. This indicates China is actively transforming from an AI participant to a leader, promoting the establishment of a fairer and more inclusive global AI governance system. Concurrently, the UN Secretary-General's Special Envoy on Technology pointed out that India will host the first global AI summit in 2026, showing the rapidly evolving geographical landscape of AI governance.
*   **"Physical AI" Accelerates Manufacturing Integration**:
    *   China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and seven other departments jointly issued the "Implementation Opinions for the 'AI+Manufacturing' Special Action," aiming to launch **1,000 high-level industrial intelligent agents** by **2027**, create 100 high-quality datasets in the industrial sector, and promote 500 typical application scenarios. This policy aims to accelerate the integration of AI technology in manufacturing, promoting a leap from "digital AI" to "physical AI," allowing AI to move beyond data analysis to become an "industrial brain" deeply integrated with factory equipment and robots.
    *   South Korea's **Hyundai Motor Group** announced at CES 2026 that it has completed development of AI chips for robots. These "device-side AI chips" operate at ultra-low power, helping robots perform more human-like tasks such as real-time identification and decision-making, particularly suitable for environments with unstable network connectivity, like underground parking lots or logistics centers.
    *   **RealMan Robotics** also showcased its "embodied intelligence infrastructure" at CES 2026, including ultra-lightweight humanoid robot arms and a global remote operation network, dedicated to redefining human labor through large-scale social deployment of robots.
    *   **Arm** explicitly stated that its future will be repositioned around "physical AI" and robotics, believing that embodied intelligence can solve the bottleneck of physical task labor expansion in modern economies, leading to productivity gains in manufacturing, construction, healthcare, and logistics.
    *   China's UniX AI also made its debut at CES 2026, displaying its mass-produced wheeled bipedal humanoid robot Wanda 2.0, emphasizing its integrated tech stack that enables scaled autonomous operations in the real world.
*   **Computing Power and Domestic Progress**:
    *   Tesla and SpaceX CEO **Elon Musk** noted in a podcast that China's power generation capacity is expected to reach approximately **three times** that of the United States by **2026**, which will allow it to "far surpass the rest of the world" in AI computing power. He believes electricity supply, rather than chips, is the primary limitation for expanding AI systems.
    *   Chinese local AI chip company **Iluvatar CoreX** (芯動科技) saw its stock surge over **31.54%** after its Hong Kong Initial Public Offering (IPO), with its market valuation exceeding **HKD 48.37 billion**, being seen as the "true leader" of China's domestic large model "computing power chip backbone." A 2025 Morgan Stanley report also predicted that China's self-sufficiency rate for AI GPUs could reach **82%** by 2027.
    *   Guangzhou City released the "Guangzhou Planning for Accelerating the Construction of a Strong Advanced Manufacturing City (2024-2035)," which mentions implementing the "East Data West Computing" strategy, encouraging enterprises to explore "computing power enclave" models, and supporting market-driven smart computing infrastructure construction. The goal is to cultivate **over 1,000 AI industry-specific models** by 2035.
    *   GIGABYTE showcased its AI TOP series products at CES 2026, emphasizing the shift of AI inference from the cloud to local devices. The AI TOP system enables local AI development at a consumer standard, supporting AI models with up to **405 billion parameters**.
*   **AI Application Mainstreaming and Super Apps**:
    *   TCL demonstrated its smart terminal products in collaboration with Microsoft AI at CES 2026, including smart displays, mobile devices, wearables, and smart home appliances. Applications span voice recognition, real-time captioning, cross-language translation, and personalized recommendations, aiming to provide a more efficient and convenient user experience.
    *   Google updated Gmail with a series of AI tools, such as an "AI Inbox" that automatically organizes emails, an "AI Overview" that provides summaries in search results, and functions to proofread and draft emails using the Gemini 3 model. This makes AI more practical in daily communication, as we saw in [AI Comes Alive: Is Your New Year's Coworker an Errand Robot or a Smarter AI Assistant?](/blog/2026-01-01-012420), AI's applications are gradually permeating our lives.
    *   According to TechNews, the proportion of US companies adopting AI has reached **17%**, projected to increase to approximately **20%** in the next six months. AI applications are expanding from the tech industry to traditional sectors like manufacturing, construction, hospitality, and transportation.
    *   The Zhipu AI Research Institute (智源人工智能研究院) in China also released its "2026 Top Ten AI Technology Trends," indicating that AI applications will shift from pursuing general capabilities to deeply solving pain points in vertical domains. Enterprise-level intelligent agents will be widely deployed in core business processes such as R&D, customer service, and office automation. For consumers, an "All in One" "super app" portal will emerge, exemplified by Ant Group's full-modal AI assistant "Lingguang" and AI health application "Ant Afu."
    *   Norwegian energy giant Equinor saved **$130 million** in 2025 by using collaborative AI (copilots), chatbots, and agentic AI.
*   **AI's Impact on Labor and Challenges**:
    *   A study published in the journal *Occupational Medicine* found that while AI implementation can handle basic tasks, it transforms workers from "executors" to "AI housekeepers," who must supervise AI systems, verify results, and correct errors. This increases **"hidden workload"** and psychological pressure. More concerningly, this upgrade in responsibility has not been reflected in salaries, potentially leading to increased burdens for knowledge workers and downward pressure on compensation. This echoes our discussion on AI's impact on the workforce in [AI Intern Evolves into Super Teammate! Tech Industry Jubilant, But Your Wallet and Trust Might Be 'TBD'?](/blog/2026-01-02-011829).
    *   A Flinders University study emphasized that AI systems must "complement" rather than "hinder" employee safety and well-being.
    *   Forrester predicts that by 2026, 30% of large enterprises will mandate AI literacy training for employees, making AI collaboration a fundamental job skill.
    *   MIT predicts that approximately **11%** of jobs in the US face the risk of being replaced by AI, which could redefine or even eliminate many entry-level positions. This impact will lead to "job polarization," with high-end positions expanding and mid-level positions systematically contracting.

### What Does This Mean for Us?

For "ordinary people who don't understand code" like us, these advancements mean:

*   **Life will be more convenient, but also potentially more "AI-surrounded"**: From your smart home appliances to mobile apps, AI will be ubiquitous, making your life smarter and more personalized. TCL's collaboration with Microsoft is an example; your [smart glasses](/blog/2026-01-08-011829) might know you better than you know yourself. But this also means your data footprint will be more diverse and extensive.
*   **Workplace reshuffle; evolve or be eliminated**: AI is no longer just a chatbot; it will genuinely enter factories and offices to perform tasks. Previously, "knowing how to code" was an advantage; now, even "collaborating with AI" has become a basic skill. If your job involves highly repetitive, rule-based tasks, you really need to start thinking about how to upgrade your "AI housekeeper" skills, otherwise, your job might not be safe. As we mentioned in [AI Battle Royale: Robot Interns on Duty, OpenAI Secretly Building Hardware – Is Your Job Safe?](/blog/2026-01-04-012521), skill upgrading is already urgent.
*   **"Physical AI" will change our world**: When robots can perceive, understand, and operate in the physical world autonomously, they won't just be in factories; they might enter your home, stores, and hospitals. This will be the moment when AI truly "grows limbs" after the digital revolution. In the future, your delivery person might be a robot, and most factory work will be done by robots.
*   **International competition intensifies; are we spectators or participants?**: The competition for AI governance and computing infrastructure is a national-level affair. China is actively promoting global AI governance standards and demonstrating ambition in computing power. This not only affects technological development but could also impact global trade and geopolitics.

### Insider's Deep Analysis

From these latest developments, the AI industry is undergoing a profound transformation from "software-defined" to "hardware and physical world collaboration."

First, **"physical AI" and "embodied intelligence" are the next battlegrounds.** Nvidia's Jensen Huang's prophecy is not groundless; when AI evolves from merely processing information as a "brain" to having a "body" that can actually act, the economic value it creates will be incomparable to digital AI. The actions of Hyundai, RealMan Robotics, and UniX AI all indicate that robots will become the most direct outlet for AI applications, especially in labor-scarce manufacturing. This will be the ultimate solution for **"cost reduction and efficiency increase."** Investors should not only focus on computing chips themselves but also on hardware, sensors, robot platforms, and related data training services that can connect AI with the physical world.

Second, **the competition for computing infrastructure extends from chips to "electricity."** Musk's "electricity theory," while perhaps exaggerated, indeed points out a critical bottleneck in AI development. The enormous energy consumption required for training and deploying large AI models is making electricity supply and cooling technology new strategic resources. China's "East Data West Computing" strategy and its advantage in power generation provide it with unique leverage in the AI computing race. For Taiwan's supply chain, in addition to chips, data centers, power management, green energy, and other related industries will also see new opportunities. Iluvatar CoreX's success in Hong Kong's stock market also illustrates the huge potential of domestic chips in specific markets, especially with national strategic support.

Furthermore, **the commercialization logic of AI applications is changing.** In recent years, corporate investment in AI has primarily focused on "cost savings," but Thoughtworks' survey shows that 77% of large enterprises globally have shifted their AI application focus to "growth and innovation," valuing AI's ability to drive revenue growth, improve products, and open new markets. This means that AI's value is no longer just about improving efficiency but has become a core competitiveness and growth engine for enterprises. Enterprise-level intelligent agents and consumer-facing "super apps" will be two important directions. Whoever can integrate AI functions most seamlessly and understand users best will stand out in the market.

Finally, **the structural impact of AI on the workforce cannot be ignored.** The research revealing "hidden workload" and stagnant wages is a warning sign for businesses and policymakers. If AI merely makes employees more tired and anxious without commensurate rewards, it will have negative consequences. When implementing AI, companies must re-evaluate job responsibilities, quantify "hidden workload," and consider how to redistribute value to ensure that AI's development leads to **"human-machine collaboration for mutual benefit"** rather than "AI exploitation." This also reminds us that the education system must accelerate its transformation to cultivate a new generation of workers equipped with AI collaboration skills, as emphasized in [2026 Is Not the Year of AI Explosion, But the First Wave of Agentic AI Project Elimination](/blog/2026-01-09-012800); AI literacy will become a new workplace prerequisite.

### One-Liner Summary

AI now doesn't just think, it acts; bosses are rushing to hire AI armies, but don't forget to give human "AI housekeepers" a raise, or your super intern might just work you to death!
