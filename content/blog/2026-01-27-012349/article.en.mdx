### What Does This Mean for Us?
This news impacts us in many ways.

First, and most directly, the way we interact with technology products will undergo revolutionary changes. Imagine **Siri** no longer being the assistant that often "doesn't understand what you're saying," but rather one that can converse as fluently as a human, even completing more complex tasks for you.
