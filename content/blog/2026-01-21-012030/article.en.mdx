### What Happened?

Today's (January 21, 2026) AI news has been absolutely dizzying, making it feel like the entire tech world is sprinting forward, not just thinking on computer screens, but truly 'getting hands-on' to reshape our physical world! What surprised me most is that an AI startup named **Humans&** secured an astonishing **$480 million** in seed funding, valuing the company at **$4.48 billion**. These aren't ordinary figures; it's practically the 'ceiling' for a seed round! This company was co-founded by former researchers from Anthropic, xAI, and Google. Their core philosophy is "human-centric," hoping AI will augment human collaboration rather than replace it.

Meanwhile, software consulting giant **Thoughtworks** also launched their **AI/works™** platform. The impressive thing about this platform is its ability to develop software, test code, and even accelerate the modernization of legacy systems using AI-powered intelligent agents. For enterprises burdened with heavy "historical baggage," this is like a timely rescue.

On another front, the marketing world hasn't been idle either. According to a report by **Proximic by Comscore**, over **eighty percent (82%)** of marketers now consider AI-driven optimization indispensable in programmatic advertising. Moreover, investments in programmatic advertising are expected to continue increasing this year, with Connected TV (CTV) and audio ads poised to be key growth drivers.

Furthermore, AI is demonstrating exciting potential in the energy sector. A study revealed that AI can significantly improve the accuracy of electricity price predictions, which can effectively lower our electricity bills and make renewable energy more efficient.

And when it comes to "getting hands-on," this year's **CES 2026** is definitely a watershed moment. NVIDIA CEO **Jensen Huang** even stated, "The ChatGPT moment for 'physical AI' has arrived!" This means AI is no longer just virtual intelligence on a screen but is set to move into the real world, controlling robots, autonomous vehicles, industrial equipment, and more.

### Simply Put, What Is This?

Imagine AI as an incredibly fast-learning "super assistant." Previously, it might have mainly helped you write reports and find information—all tasks in the "virtual world" that required thinking. But now, it's not just your scribe anymore; it's becoming your "all-around housekeeper" and "factory foreman"!

**Humans&** is like a super-intelligent "team collaborator." It's not here to replace you but to be a member of your team, helping you research, organize information, and even offering real-time collaboration suggestions in group chats to make your communication smoother and more efficient. It's like having a smart partner who can "brainstorm" with you anytime, rather than a robot that only gives one-way commands.

And **Thoughtworks' AI/works™**? You can imagine it as a super-automated "software factory." For old, complex enterprise systems, it's like that decades-old classic car in your garage; upgrading it is a nightmare. But AI/works™ can act like an experienced technician, automatically analyzing the classic car's internal structure, generating new designs and parts, and even assembling and testing them automatically, transforming your classic car into an electric sports car in an instant, and continuously optimizing it based on your driving habits.

As for **AI in marketing**, this is like your private shopping consultant upgraded to a "super oracle." Previously, it might have just recommended products based on your preferences; now, it can accurately predict when and in what context you're most likely to click on which ad, and even automatically adjust ad content, making you feel, "This ad was tailor-made for me!"

In terms of **power prediction**, AI is like the power company's "weather forecaster" and "smart dispatcher." It not only tells you if it will rain tomorrow (power generation) but also accurately predicts wind power, solar intensity, and even households' peak electricity usage, then automatically helps the grid dispatch power. This allows power plants to utilize renewable energy more efficiently, reduce waste, and ultimately make our electricity bills cheaper and more stable.

Finally, **"physical AI"**—this is truly impressive! Previously, robots might have just followed programs like clumsy apprentices. But NVIDIA's "physical AI" turns robots into true "skilled workers" that can see, hear, think, and even assess environments and make their own decisions like humans. Imagine robots in factories flexibly moving goods, assembling complex parts, and even responding to unexpected situations just like people – this is truly a scene from science fiction movies coming to life! This also reminds me of previous [AI Daily] articles like [AI Not Just Thinking But Acting: From "Private Brains" to "Physical Laborers," How AI Will Change You and Me in 2026!](/blog/2026-01-20-011757) and [AI's Great Leap: From Virtual Intelligence to Physical Labor, Plus a "Private Brain" in Your Wallet!](/blog/2026-01-19-012230), showing how strong the trend of AI moving from virtual to physical truly is.

#### 💡 Energy Forecasting and Physical AI: AI Makes the Physical World Smarter

In the energy and infrastructure sectors, AI's potential is equally immense. Dr. **Mark Sinclair**, a doctoral researcher at the University of New England in Australia, confirmed that utilizing **transformer models** (the same AI architecture as ChatGPT) can significantly improve the accuracy of electricity price predictions, even reducing forecast errors by nearly half. This is highly significant for countries like Australia with volatile electricity markets. Accurate electricity forecasting helps batteries charge at the right time, generators make optimal decisions, and reduces defensive measures by grid operators, ultimately lowering costs for consumers and increasing renewable energy efficiency.

And this year's **CES 2026** Consumer Electronics Show, held from January 6-9 in Las Vegas, explicitly marked the birth of **"physical AI."** NVIDIA CEO **Jensen Huang** noted in his keynote speech that "the ChatGPT moment for physical AI has arrived," emphasizing that AI will transform from virtual tools into active participants capable of understanding, reasoning, and acting in the real world.

NVIDIA unveiled several new models and technologies for physical AI at CES 2026, such as the **Cosmos** platform and **Isaac GR00T**. The Cosmos platform is likened to "Android for robots," offering open-world foundation models trained on 20 million hours of robot data, capable of creating physically simulated training scenarios through synthetic data generation technology. Isaac GR00T focuses on humanoid robot control, handling joints, movement, and motion. **Boston Dynamics** also showcased a real-time demonstration of its Atlas humanoid robot and announced a partnership with **Google DeepMind** to integrate the Gemini Robotics AI model into Atlas, enabling robots to learn new behaviors more quickly.

#### 🐉 China's AI Industry: Rapid Rise and Global Impact

China's momentum in AI development is equally robust, with several domestic companies like **DeepSeek, Zhipu AI, and MiniMax** making significant strides in open-source and cost-effective models. Notably, **DeepSeek's** low-cost generative AI model, released in January 2025, performed comparably to ChatGPT, stunning the industry and greatly boosting the confidence of many Chinese AI developers.

**Zhipu AI** even claimed that their first major model, **GLM-Image**, was entirely trained on Huawei chips. This signifies China's ability to develop powerful multimodal models without relying on US chips, undoubtedly a major breakthrough against American chip sanctions. China's AI industry is striving to deeply integrate AI into all aspects of society and position AI as part of public service. This demonstrates China's growing independent innovation capabilities and global influence in the AI sector.

#### 🎓 AI Popularization, Strategic Deployment, and ROI Challenges

On the other hand, AI's popularization is even more widespread than imagined. A global survey by Google and Ipsos revealed that **learning** has surpassed entertainment as the primary purpose for people using AI. Students, teachers, and parents are leading global AI adoption, reshaping how education interacts with AI tools. For instance, in Nigeria, as many as **93%** of respondents use AI for learning or understanding complex topics, significantly higher than the global average of **74%**.

However, enterprises still face enormous challenges in translating AI from experimental phases into tangible business value. Recent data shows that only **25%** of AI projects achieve their expected return on investment (ROI), and a mere **16%** are successfully scaled within enterprises. This means that up to **84%** of AI projects, even if they performed well in pilot phases, failed to make it into production environments.

Experts emphasize that enterprises often make the mistake of starting with the question "How can we use AI?" rather than "What problem do we need to solve?" Without clear business objectives and sound management strategies, even the most impressive AI technology can become a "graveyard of AI projects." This again reminds us that technology is merely a tool; how it is effectively utilized and integrated with organizational culture, processes, and personnel capabilities is key to AI's success. We have also discussed this issue in [AI Megatrends: Money No Longer Just Poured into Infrastructure; Now It's About How Much AI "Helps You Earn"!](/blog/2026-01-14-012054).

### What Does This Mean for Us?

These AI developments will have a profound impact on everyone's life and work, and I'm not exaggerating.

**For Our Daily Lives:**

*   **Learning Becomes Easier Than Ever Before!** Google's survey tells us that AI has become our "private tutor" for learning new knowledge and understanding complex concepts. Imagine, content that used to take us hours to research can now be quickly summarized by AI, even explained in a way that's easiest for you to understand. This virtually lowers the barrier to learning, enabling everyone to become a lifelong learner.
*   **The Physical World Will Be Smarter and More Convenient.** NVIDIA's demonstration of "physical AI" means that in the future, our living spaces, from smart home appliances to urban public facilities, will be filled with AI that can perceive and think. Your robot vacuum cleaner might not just clean; it might learn to avoid your scattered socks and even check if doors and windows are closed when you're away. Future transportation could become smoother due to AI's precise predictions, and power supply more stable due to AI optimization, reducing power outages.
*   **Work Models Transform, But It's Augmentation, Not Replacement.** Humans&'s "human-centric" AI philosophy shows me that AI isn't here to steal your job; it's here to give you a "super add-on." Imagine your work report no longer needing to start from scratch; AI helps you gather data and structure the framework, allowing you to focus on strategy and creativity. Repetitive, time-consuming tasks will be handled by AI agents, freeing your energy for more valuable endeavors. This compels us to rethink what human value in the workplace will be: perhaps those things AI cannot do, such as emotional connection, creativity, and complex interpersonal interactions. This also links to previous discussions such as [AI Shockwave: Job Security, International Allies, Ethical Boundaries - What's the AI Circle Buzzing About in Early 2026?](/blog/2026-01-16-084634) and [AI Earthquake! Job Security at Risk? The US-China Compute War, and Your AI Colleagues Are Ready for Work!](/blog/2026-01-15-011640).

**For Businesses and Industries:**

*   **Digital Transformation Is No Longer Just a Slogan, But a Substantive AI-Driven Change.** Thoughtworks' AI/works™ platform proves that even "elephant-sized" enterprises with vast, outdated systems can achieve rapid and efficient modernization through AI. This means businesses can respond more quickly to market changes, launch new products and services, and no longer be bogged down by technical debt.
*   **Precision Marketing Becomes the New Normal, Resource Allocation More Efficient.** Marketers' demand for AI optimization has sharply increased, which will lead to more precise and efficient ad placement. The old "broadcasting net" marketing model will gradually be phased out, replaced by customized targeting based on data and AI analysis for specific audiences. This will not only save advertising budgets but also improve ad effectiveness.
*   **Energy Management Will Enter a Smart Era, Reducing Environmental Pressure.** The precision of electricity price forecasting will lead to more stable grid operations, especially for the growing renewable energy sector. This will not only reduce operating costs but also decrease energy waste, positively impacting global efforts to combat climate change.
*   **The Rise of Chinese AI Will Reshape the Global Tech Landscape.** Chinese companies like DeepSeek and Zhipu AI, with their progress in open-source models and independent chip training, demonstrate China's formidable strength in global AI competition. This will intensify global AI competition and may prompt more countries to invest resources in developing indigenous AI ecosystems, accelerating innovation.
*   **The Key to Successful AI Projects Lies in "Strategy" Not "Technology."** The ROI challenge faced by enterprises sounds an alarm. This reminds us that blindly pursuing "cool" AI technology is unsustainable; it's essential to return to business fundamentals, clearly define the problems to be solved, and establish comprehensive deployment and management strategies.

### Insider's Deep Analysis

Looking at today's AI news, I see two extremely important trends accelerating and converging: one is **AI beginning to "deepen" and "optimize" existing processes**, and the other is **AI starting to "step out of the screen" and "take action."**

**Deepening Optimization:**
Platforms like Thoughtworks' AI/works™ and AI optimization in programmatic advertising tell us that AI is no longer just a nice-to-have; it's becoming part of the "heart" and "veins" of enterprises. It's no longer content with generating some content or answering a few questions but is getting involved in the most fundamental software development processes and the most complex marketing decisions to boost efficiency and cut costs. It's like AI has transformed from a clever consultant into a "senior engineer" who personally rolls up their sleeves and gets to work.

The ROI challenge for enterprise AI projects, in particular, resonates deeply with me. I often say, **AI isn't a magic wand; it's just an incredibly powerful tool.** If you haven't even clarified the problem, or if you don't have enough "people" to understand and utilize this tool, then even the best AI will just be an expensive decoration. What enterprises need to do is think strategically about what true business value AI can bring them, rather than blindly following trends. This requires not just technological investment but a comprehensive transformation of organizational culture, talent training, and management processes.

<InsightQuote
  type="insight"
  content=" 'Many enterprises, when deploying AI, start from technology looking for applications, rather than from business problems looking for solutions. This is the fundamental reason why most AI projects become "experiments" instead of "productivity tools."' "
  author="Me"
  role="Senior Investigative Journalist"
/>

**Stepping Out of the Screen:**
NVIDIA's emphasis on "physical AI" at CES 2026, and Humans&'s pursuit of "human-centric" collaborative AI, show me the next crucial stage of AI development. AI isn't just about "thinking"; it's also about "acting"! This isn't merely progress in robotics technology but a qualitative shift in AI's ability to perceive, understand, and interact with the physical world. When AI can learn, reason, and perform complex tasks in real environments, just like humans, it will completely transform manufacturing, logistics, healthcare, and even our home lives. This is a massive platform shift, much like the internet and cloud computing of yesteryear, which will spawn countless new applications and business models.

At the same time, Humans&'s "human-centric" philosophy offers an important direction for thought. As we pursue AI's powerful capabilities, we must never forget human value. AI should be an extension of us, our collaborator, not something that replaces our existence. Finding the balance between the immense power of AI and human creativity and emotion will be an eternal challenge in future AI development.

The rise of China's AI industry, especially its ability to train models on Huawei chips, also deeply impressed me. This is not just a technological breakthrough but also an embodiment of technological sovereignty in a geopolitical context. This will intensify global AI competition and may prompt more countries to invest resources in developing indigenous AI ecosystems.

### One-Liner Summary

Today's AI news reveals that AI isn't just learning and growing in our minds; it's now preparing to 'show its true colors,' invasively changing the world from code to physical robots, from marketing strategies to energy management, yet human wisdom and strategy remain the most crucial 'drivers' of this transformation!
