### What Happened?

Hey everyone, good morning! If you've been keeping up with tech news these past few days, you'll probably feel the same way I do – like the whole world has been swept up by this AI whirlwind! Today's (January 16, 2026) AI headlines are truly a double feature of "burning cash" and "getting hands-on." I'm seeing global enterprises' enthusiasm for AI officially leap from the lab stage to a core strategic imperative. People are no longer just engaging in theoretical discussions; they're investing real money, and they want AI to genuinely help them get things done!

This wave of AI isn't just impacting tech giants; even Taiwan's semiconductor industry is reaping significant benefits, truly flourishing from this bonanza. However, alongside this boom comes astronomical computing power demands, and those persistent challenges like AI ethics, privacy, and fraud. It feels like driving a supercar—fast, but requiring careful navigation to avoid accidents.

### Simply Put, What Is This?

Imagine AI used to be like a "gifted student who only knows how to study." It could absorb vast amounts of knowledge, compute complex formulas, and write perfect reports, but it wasn't very good at "**doing things themselves**." Today, we're seeing a major shift: AI is no longer just sitting in front of a computer, typing away. It's stepping out of the software world and into our physical world, learning to "**get hands-on**"!

This kind of AI, transitioning from virtual to physical, we call "**Physical AI**." It's like giving this gifted student a pair of nimble hands, allowing it to drive smart cars, operate robots to move things for you, and even monitor your health. This isn't just about making AI smarter; it's about integrating it into our lives, making it your personal "**AI intern**."

To enable this "AI intern" to have enough brainpower to "get hands-on," it needs immense "**computing power**." Computing power is like our brain's processing capacity; the smarter AI becomes, and the more complex tasks it undertakes, the greater the computing power it requires. This explains why global enterprises are scrambling for AI chips and servers, and why even a leader like OpenAI has to scour the world for partners to ensure its "brain" won't starve (for resources).

### According to Reports, Details Are as Follows

According to today's topic analysis, global AI spending is projected to grow substantially. Enterprise investment in AI has shifted from the experimental phase to a core strategic imperative, indicating that AI has become a critical engine for driving business growth. This boom is a godsend for Taiwan's semiconductor industry, with orders pouring in for major manufacturers, and revenue also expected to grow robustly as a result. Demand is particularly surging in the AI chip and server sectors; companies like TSMC, which master advanced manufacturing processes, are projected to see continued revenue growth in the AI accelerator field.

At **CES 2026** (International Consumer Electronics Show) in Las Vegas, USA, we witnessed numerous "Physical AI" applications taking root. These weren't just conceptual displays but many concrete products and services across smart mobility, robotics, and personal health management, all integrated with AI. For example, autonomous driving technology uses AI to predict road conditions and optimize routes, home robot vacuums have become smarter thanks to AI, and even your smartwatch can leverage AI to analyze your heart rate, providing early warnings for health risks. This transforms AI from mere code on a screen into a real helper in our daily lives.

However, the flip side of AI development also presents challenges. AI ethics, data privacy, algorithmic bias, and regulatory frameworks have become issues that governments and businesses worldwide must confront. AI fraud techniques are becoming increasingly sophisticated, and the misuse of non-consensual AI-generated content like DeepNude AI has sounded the cybersecurity alarm. This reminds me of our previous discussions regarding AI fraud and privacy issues; this area will only grow more complex in the future.

<Callout type="info" title="Cybersecurity Alert! The Risks of AI Fraud and DeepNude">
As AI technology becomes widespread, new forms of fraud are emerging endlessly, utilizing AI-generated fake information, voices, or images that make it difficult to distinguish truth from falsehood. Concurrently, the misuse of non-consensual AI-generated content (such as DeepNude AI) severely infringes upon personal privacy and rights. The public must remain highly vigilant, and governments and tech companies need to enhance technical prevention and regulatory frameworks to collectively address these challenges.

In terms of international cooperation and competition, China has demonstrated a leading edge in the speed of AI application adoption. Meanwhile, Japan and ASEAN nations have also reached a series of cooperation agreements on AI development and related laws, indicating increasingly frequent collaboration alongside competition in the global AI landscape. Taiwan continues to deepen its strategic partnership with the United States in AI and semiconductor fields, solidifying our critical position in the supply chain.

### What Does This Mean for Us?

I think the most direct impact is that our daily lives and work methods are being subtly reshaped by AI. Think about it: administrative tasks that used to take you hours might now be sorted out by an AI intern in seconds. For us, this is both a challenge and an opportunity. The challenge lies in having to learn to collaborate with AI and enhance your own value; the opportunity is that AI can free us from tedious, repetitive labor to create more meaningful things.

At the industry level, Taiwan's semiconductor industry will undoubtedly remain busy, even busy beyond measure, which is a great boon for Taiwan's economy. However, the global frantic pursuit of AI computing power also raises concerns about energy crises and resource consumption. As we've mentioned before, AI development requires immense energy support—this is an unavoidable challenge.

### Insider's Deep Analysis

My personal observation is that this wave of AI enthusiasm is no longer just a technological race; it's a comprehensive competition of **resources and strategic deployment**. Looking at OpenAI's active pursuit of diversified computing power supplies, the giants clearly understand the principle that "whoever commands computing power, commands the world." This also means that the stability and diversification of the AI chip supply chain will be a critical bargaining chip for countries developing AI in the future. We cannot put all our eggs in one basket, especially with geopolitical risks on the rise.

Furthermore, the rise of "Physical AI" signifies that AI applications are moving from virtual information processing to real-world physical interaction. This is a massive transformation, turning AI from an "intellectual laborer" into a practitioner who "uses both brain and brawn." From robots entering factories to the widespread adoption of smart home devices, AI is truly "taking root." This also means that new business models and industrial chains are forming, from sensors and actuators to AI chips and software algorithms, every link is brimming with immense business opportunities.

> "The evolution of AI is like a scholar who only knew how to read transforming into an engineer capable of hands-on practice. It not only changes how we work but redefines how we interact with the world."

However, we cannot overlook the challenges of AI ethics and fraud. As AI becomes capable of creating increasingly realistic fake images, fake voices, and even simulating human emotions and reactions, the ability to discern truth from falsehood will become unprecedentedly crucial. This requires not only technical prevention but also critical thinking from the general public, as well as governments and international organizations working together to establish comprehensive regulations. Only then can we enjoy the convenience of AI while avoiding its potential harms. In this "AI battle royale," there are not only opportunities but also risks.

### One-Liner Summary

Today's AI world is no longer just "strategizing behind the scenes" on a keyboard; it has donned its work clothes, rolled up its sleeves, and is ready to "get hands-on"! This "AI money-burning war" isn't just about whose brainpower (computing power) is stronger; it's about who can truly transform AI's intelligence into tangible action! But let's not forget, while enjoying all this convenience, we must also keep our eyes wide open and guard against the AI pitfalls lurking in the shadows, so this technological feast can develop healthily and sustainably.
