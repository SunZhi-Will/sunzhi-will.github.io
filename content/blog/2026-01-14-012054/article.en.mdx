### What Happened? (Like telling gossip)
Today (January 14, 2026), the AI world is experiencing one wave after another! The hottest gossip is that the craze for pouring money into building AI super-brains (computing infrastructure and large models) has finally returned to rationality. Money isn't just being scattered randomly anymore; instead, there's a greater focus on whether AI can truly "land and generate profit," creating actual commercial value.

Amidst this trend, domestic AI giants **Zhipu Huazhang** and **MiniMax** have successfully listed in Hong Kong, with MiniMax's market cap soaring past ¥100 billion on its first day of trading, proving market confidence with hard cash. This is no small feat; it signifies that the AI industry has officially entered a phase of "proving it can make money."

At the same time, AI is making significant inroads into our daily lives, from smart glasses to foldable devices. These "AI little helpers" are poised to seamlessly integrate into our world, even handling payments for us.

However, every coin has two sides. As AI gallops ahead like a wild horse, concerns about an "AI bubble," copyright disputes, and privacy and governance issues are growing increasingly troublesome. Wall Street's attitude towards creative software giant **Adobe** has taken a sharp turn for the worse, with analysts believing it might struggle significantly under AI competition. The UK government has also swiftly stepped in, stating its intention to "reset" AI copyright policy, hoping to protect creators without hindering AI development. This AI revolution certainly seems lively, leaving us both excited and wary.

### Simply Put, What Is This? (Metaphor time)
Imagine AI as a super-smart, but previously only book-smart, genius student. For the past few years, investors have been like generous parents, constantly pouring money into buying him the best library (computing power) and hiring the best teachers (large model research), hoping he would become incredibly knowledgeable. But now, the parents are starting to ask: "You've studied so much, can you go out and find a job to help the family earn some money?"

So, the current focus of AI investment has shifted from "building libraries and finding teachers" to "seeing if this genius student can apply his knowledge to actual work and make money to support the family." Zhipu Huazhang and MiniMax going public is like this genius student finally graduating and landing a high-paying job, proving his commercial value.

As for smart glasses and foldable devices, they're like this genius student finally mastering "multi-tasking prowess," capable of helping us handle things through various everyday objects. Your smart glasses are no longer just a tool for seeing scenery; they can now act like your personal assistant, helping you translate, navigate, and even handle payments. It's like having an intern who can fetch your coffee and manage various errands, rather than just a dictionary that answers questions.

Regarding the concerns for **Adobe**, it's like an established, highly skilled painter suddenly discovering a group of young artists who use magic brushes (AI drawing tools) to create exquisite works faster and cheaper. Although the old painter is masterfully skilled, the market is starting to worry if his business will be snatched away by these newcomers, even causing his stock price to fall.

### According to Reports, Details Are as Follows
The core information today is that the AI industry's investment compass has clearly pointed towards **application implementation and commercial value realization**. According to reports from Securities Daily and People's Daily Online, since 2026, China's large model industry has seen continuous positive developments. **Beijing Zhipu Huazhang Technology Co., Ltd.** successfully listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, becoming the "world's first large model stock," followed by **MiniMax** also listing on the HKEX, with its total market capitalization exceeding **¥100 billion** on its first day. The listings of these two companies are seen as a clear signal from the capital market that the main theme of AI investment has begun to shift towards application value. Simultaneously, Alibaba's Qwen open-source large model has seen explosive growth, and DeepSeek's new model is also set for release.

This shift also emits three positive signals: Firstly, technological value is moving from "laboratories" to "production lines," accelerating the formation of commercial closed-loops. For instance, Sany Renewable Energy's wind turbine blade factory reduced product defect rates by over 20% and delivery times by over 30% through a digital platform. Secondly, industrial empowerment is transitioning from "single-point breakthroughs" to "panoramic penetration," accelerating the upgrading of the real economy. The "AI+Manufacturing" special action plan further proposes to launch **1,000** high-level industrial intelligent bodies and promote **500** typical application scenarios by **2027**.

In the consumer device sector, AI is rapidly integrating into daily life. IDC estimates that **AI smart glasses shipments could exceed 9 million units by 2026, with the overall market size reaching $7.5 billion**. Google plans to launch two AI smart glasses in 2026; one focusing on audio interaction, and another with an integrated lens display. Recently at CES 2026, **Rokid** showcased its voice-activated AI glasses, which can complete payments via **Alipay + GlassPay** through voice commands, QR code scanning, and iris recognition, priced at **$299**. Other brands like **HTC VIVE Eagle**, **Meta Ray-Ban Display Smart Glasses**, and **RayNeo X3 Pro** integrating **Google Gemini AI** have also been unveiled, offering features such as real-time translation and AR navigation. Furthermore, the application of eSIM cards allows smart glasses to operate independently of smartphones, becoming more standalone AI terminals. Lenovo also introduced its **AI Glasses** concept product, weighing approximately **45 grams**, with a battery life of up to **8 hours**, and supporting multimodal intelligent capabilities.

However, the accompanying challenges are not to be underestimated. Wall Street analysts' outlook on creative software giant **Adobe (ADBE-US)** has sharply deteriorated, with its market consensus rating falling to its lowest in over a decade at **3.91 out of 5**. Oppenheimer analyst **Brian Schwartz** downgraded Adobe's rating to "Neutral," and Goldman Sachs analyst **Gabriela Borges** issued a "Sell" rating, noting that AI is "democratizing design tools," potentially limiting the expansion space for Adobe's core professional creator demographic. Adobe's stock price has fallen **6.4%** this year and accumulated a decline of over **45%** since the end of 2023.

Moreover, AI governance and ethical issues are gaining increasing attention. UK Tech Minister **Liz Kendall** stated on Tuesday (January 13) that the government is seeking a "reset" on AI copyright rules, promising to protect creators while unleashing AI's economic potential. She admitted that the government's previous proposal allowing developers to train models on any legally obtained data using an "opt-out" mechanism was a mistake. Today's (January 14) report also cited investor **Ray Dalio**, who warned that AI is in an "early bubble phase," anticipating that overpriced stocks might face a "reality check" in 2026, and noting that up to 95% of generative AI pilot projects have yet to turn a profit. Additionally, "shadow AI" (employees inputting sensitive company data into public AI tools) poses significant legal and security risks.

Local governments are also actively planning AI industry development. India's Uttar Pradesh is seen as a "critical testing ground" for AI solutions, having announced its **AI Mission** and allocated approximately **₹200 billion (around $2 billion USD)** over three years to boost it. The New Zealand government also launched an AI advisory pilot program, providing SMEs with guidance on privacy, data management, and responsible AI use, investing **$765,000**.

In materials science, AI also shows strong potential. Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory's **Materials Project** is hailed as the most cited data and analysis tool in materials science, used **5,000 times daily** by over **650,000** registered users, and considered "infrastructure" for AI-driven materials design.

### What Does This Mean for Us?
The shift in AI investment logic means that AI companies solely focused on burning money for basic research without clear business models might face tougher times ahead. Conversely, companies capable of transforming AI technology into tangible, profitable products or services will be more favored by the capital market. For us ordinary folks, this likely means we'll see more **AI products that are closer to daily life and solve practical problems**, rather than just fancy-sounding "futuristic tech" with unclear uses.

The rise of smart glasses heralds a more "seamless" and "natural" digital life. Imagine being able to translate, navigate, and even pay by voice without needing to pick up your phone. It's like your "second pair of eyes" and "second brain" are seamlessly connected. This also brings the concept of "Physical AI," which we discussed in [AI Deeply Integrates into Daily Life and Consumer Devices](/blog/2026-01-10-011555), step by step into reality.

**Adobe**'s case serves as a warning. Even established giants like Adobe might face immense challenges if they fail to adapt quickly to the changes brought by AI and embrace new technological trends. This also reminds us that in the age of AI, any industry can be disrupted, making learning new skills and maintaining competitiveness more crucial than ever.

Concerns about copyright disputes and an AI bubble remind us that AI development is not always a smooth road. Government intervention and policy guidance will be key to healthy AI development. We need a clearer framework to protect creators' rights while also preventing excessive speculation in the AI market and a repeat of tech bubbles. After all, as discussed in [AI Governance Towards International Cooperation and Standard Setting](/blog/2026-01-09-045335), AI governance is a global challenge.

### Insider's Deep Analysis
AI investment shifting from "burning money to build foundations" to "seeing who can rent out those foundations for profit" is an inevitable development for the industry. Initially, everyone was scrambling for computing power and models—that was infrastructure, an arms race. Now, the arms race enters its second half: those who can effectively wield these "powerful tools" to create practical value and genuine commercial profit will survive, even list on the stock exchange. The successful IPOs of Zhipu Huazhang and MiniMax are a microcosm of this shift.

Smart glasses and foldable devices are concrete manifestations of the **Edge AI** and **AI PC** concepts. As AI capabilities move from the cloud to end-user devices, our personal gadgets will become smarter and understand us better. This is not just hardware innovation; it's a profound transformation in human-machine interaction. As we discussed in [AI-Native Devices Leading Edge AI Transformation](/blog/2026-01-10-011555), future AI hardware will no longer be about "stacking features" but rather focusing on simplicity and practicality, truly achieving "no AI, no reason to exist."

**Adobe**'s predicament reveals a harsh reality in the AI era: even the largest moats can be breached by AI technology. Software giants used to rest on their laurels and make money thanks to vast user bases and ecosystems. But now, the proliferation of generative AI tools is "democratizing design tools," empowering everyone to become a creator, which undoubtedly poses a huge impact on Adobe's core business. This competition not only tests technology but also a company's ability to transform and innovate its business model.

Warnings of an AI bubble also serve as a market alert against irrational exuberance. **Ray Dalio**'s analogy and data (95% of generative AI pilot projects not yet profitable) are a wake-up call for investors chasing concepts without regard for actual revenue. 2026 is indeed AI's "year of proof," where companies must demonstrate that AI can deliver tangible benefits and profits to maintain market confidence.

The UK's "reset" on AI copyright issues demonstrates that governments, when faced with new technological challenges, are moving from a singular pursuit of openness to a more cautious balance. This not only concerns creators' livelihoods but also affects the healthy development of the AI content industry. Finding the optimal balance between encouraging innovation and protecting rights will be a common challenge for global AI governance.

From India's Uttar Pradesh with its ₹200 billion AI mission to China's various provinces with their "AI+" initiatives, governments worldwide clearly view AI as a new engine for economic growth. This is not merely a technological competition but a contest of national strategies.

### One-Liner Summary
AI is no longer just a "book-smart genius"; it now needs to "earn its keep," or even an old giant like **Adobe** might find its livelihood threatened, while your smart glasses can handle payments—what a rapidly changing world!
